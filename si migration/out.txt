BODY:
  <p>deCODE genetics, the Icelandic genomics company that declared bankruptcy in <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/326/5957/1172-a" target="_blank">November</a>, has made a comeback. Today it reappeared as <a href="http://www.decode.com/news/news.php?story=112" target="_blank">"the New deCODE,"</a> a renamed version of the previous deCODE's core business built on mining the DNA of Iceland's population for disease-causing genes. deCODE's founder, neuroscientist Kari Stefansson, is staying on as co-leader.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
  <p>Over the past decade deCODE genetics Inc. hasn't turned a profit,
but it has made a scientific splash by finding disease risk markers
using a genetic, medical, and genealogical database on 140,000
Icelanders. Last week, a bankruptcy court in Delaware approved the sale
of deCODE Inc.'s subsidiary Islensk Erfdagreining, which runs this
biobank, to Saga Investments LLC. Saga's investors include two firms
that invested in the original deCODE as well as Illumina, the
sequencing machine company in San Diego, California. The CEO of the new
private company, called deCODE genetics ehf, is Earl "Duke" Collier, a
former executive vice president at Genzyme; Stefansson will be
executive chairman and president of research. The parent company is
still selling off deCODE genetics Inc.'s drug discovery and development
components, says Stefansson.</p>  <p>The new deCODE will still focus on
human genetics, including selling diagnostic tests and a personal
genome analysis service, deCODEme. “The plan is to continue to lead the
world when it comes to human genetics," says Stefansson. It will
partner with drug companies instead of developing drugs on its own from
its gene discoveries, Collier says. Stefansson says this does not raise privacy
concerns because Iceland's data privacy and ethics laws will only
permit deCODE to "work on problems" for the companies. "We cannot
provide people unfettered access to the data," Stefansson says. </p>  <p>To
further its search for disease genes, the company plans to begin whole
genome sequencing of 2500 DNA samples from its database. It will not
need to recontact these individuals for consent because their original
consent agreements cover whole genome sequencing, Stefansson says. </p>  <p>Stefansson
dismissed allegations by dissatisfied investors that he and Collier, a
former member of the old deCODE's board, helped engineer the sale to
Saga to advance their own interests. This argument is made in a <a href="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/Objection%20of%20the%20Official%20Comm%20ofUnsecured%20Creditors%20to%20Motion.pdf">complaint</a> filed in the Delaware court in December by creditors that
charges that Stefansson, Collier, and others discouraged other parties
from bidding for the company and "may have colluded to create a deal
that will ensure their continued profit ... free and clear of claims held
by the Debtor's [deCODE's] unsecured creditors." The Delaware
bankruptcy judge approved the deal, Stefansson points out, and
"everything has been done in keeping with the law."</p><div><br /></div>

<p><b>BEIJING—</b>In a speech yesterday at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave a hard-hitting speech in defense of a free and unfettered Internet. The timing couldn’t be better, with <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/327/5964/402-a">Google pressing the Chinese</a> government to permit it to run an uncensored search engine in China. Here are a few choice excerpts of <a href="http://www.america.gov/st/texttrans-english/2010/January/20100121142618eaifas0.6585352.html">Clinton’s speech</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>[T]echnologies with the potential to open up access to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by governments to crush dissent and deny human rights.</p>
<p>On their own, new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress, but the United States does. We stand for a single internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas. </p></blockquote>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<blockquote><p>Some countries have erected electronic barriers that prevent their
people from accessing portions of the world’s networks. They’ve expunged words, names, and phrases from search engine results. They have violated the privacy of citizens who engage in non-violent political speech. These actions contravene the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which tells us that all people have the right “to
seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.” With the spread of these restrictive practices, a new information curtain is descending across much of the world. </p><p>The internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China, and it is fabulous. There are so many people in China now online. But countries that restrict free access to information or violate the basic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century. Now, the United States and China have different views on this issue, and we intend to address those differences candidly and consistently in the context of our positive, cooperative, and comprehensive relationship.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>OTTAWA—</b>Alain Beaudet, almost from the moment he became president of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research 2 years ago, has been talking about the need for a multibillion-dollar initiative to combat Alzheimer's disease and dementia. (In Canada alone, the prevalence of dementia will more than double in 30 years, according to the Alzheimer Society of Canada.) Beaudet has spoken of blazing the path with massive outlays that might inspire or leverage investments from other countries and create a global research network. </p><p>But that dream appears to have run head-on into a government deficit. Sources say Beaudet's pitch for dementia research funding to the governing Conservative Party has been massively scaled back recently—from something on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars to a far more modest $10 million. The 2010–2011 budget, sources say, would be used to craft the parameters of a national dementia strategy over the course of the next few years. Even $10 million may be too rich for Prime Minister Stephen Harper. His cabinet team is trying to reduce a deficit that has ballooned to $53.5 billion as a result of economic stimulus measures over the course of the recession. Managers are all but stumbling over themselves to lay the spadework for forthcoming budget cuts, to be unveiled in March. </p><p>Beaudet now talks about Canada as an "honest broker" of collaborative projects, rather than a big spender, and gamely hopes that his discussions with other nations will ultimately yield dividends such as an international platform to focus on early detection and treatment of dementias. "It's really not co-ordinated at present," Beaudet says. "We could share animal models. We could share cohorts of patients. We could put our minds together to develop biomarkers way faster." But he adds, "if we want to be at all significant in that game, we will have to increase our investment significantly.</p>

Prime Minister Harper is the second coming of Bush...introducing mandatory minimum sentencing and spending money on more jails and wars takes priority over science and education.

He is our national shame with a minority government supported by only 30% of our population.

The prospects aren’t good. Although Congress has mandated a goal of finding 90% of the city-killers—NEOs 140 meters in diameter or larger—by 2020, it hasn’t funded such a search. And at the current rate of funding the NEO threat wouldn’t be sized up for decades.</p>  <p>The committee chaired by geophysicist Irwin Shapiro of Harvard University “was struck by the many uncertainties that suffuse the NEO subject,” according to the report. First there are the uncertainties about the threat. For example, NEOs 30 to 50 meters in size are beginning to appear more dangerous and may—or may not—be striking Earth more frequently than thought. <br /></p>  <p>Ways of fending off NEOs on a collision course with the planet are also poorly understood, essentially untested, and could often pale beside the dreaded nuclear option of blasting them out of the way.</p>

  <p> And the most promising search tool in the works—the <a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst">Large Synoptic Survey Telescope</a>—has not been fully funded and could lose out in the ongoing project prioritization by the astronomy and astrophysics community, notes the report. The list goes on, but at least “the report is honest about the uncertainties,” says NEO researcher Richard Binzel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.</p>  <p>The committee’s bottom-line: The NEO threat is real, but the $5 million spent by the United States each year to find and better understand threatening NEOs isn’t going to achieve any measure of safety within the next few decades. It’s up to U.S. political leaders to decide how big a premium should be paid for insurance against a rare but uniquely disastrous impact, the report says. Aside from more money for research into NEOs and ways to deflect them, the report points to two approaches to achieving Congress’s detection goal. Completion of the survey by 2020 would be expensive, requiring a space mission. Cheaper but slower would involve the use of a large ground-based telescope, delaying completion until 2030. Take your pick, says the committee in so many words.</p><p>(Image of 18-kilometer wide asteroid Gaspra courtesy NASA.)</p>

Wow, one day you wake up and find out that you live in a banana republic where money can buy laws (tax reduction for hotels, yet illegal coal power plant in North Rhine-Westphalia, energy grid monopoly) and the pharmaceutical industry can get rid of disagreeable investigators at will. Not that politicians are disempowered as they can get rid of critical journalists in turn. Any scientist who currently thinks about moving to Germany should think again.

<p>Russia's research output has continued to slide since the collapse of the Soviet Union nearly 20 years ago and produced only 127,000 papers, 2.6% of the world's total, over a recent 5 year period, according to a <a href="http://researchanalytics.thomsonreuters.com/m/pdfs/grr-russia-jan10.pdf">report</a> published today by Thomson Reuters. Once a science and technology
powerhouse, Russia now ranks behind such countries as China (8.4% of the world total), Canada (4.7%), Australia (3.0%), India (2.9%), and only slightly ahead of the Netherlands (2.5%).

  <p>Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates has been supporting a wide array of research on geoengineering since 2007, Science<i>Insider</i> has learned. The world’s richest man has provided at least $4.5 million of his own money over 3 years for the study of methods that could alter the stratosphere to reflect solar energy, techniques to filter carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere, and brighten ocean clouds. But Gates’s money has not funded any field experiments involving the techniques, according to Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Palo Alto, California.</p> 
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Caldeira and physicist David Keith of the University of Calgary in Canada have been in charge of deciding how to dispense the money. The pair have been informal energy and climate <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1924149_1924154_1924428,00.html">advisers</a> to Gates for several years, and they say they remain independent. "This is philanthropic money and when it arrives [to Calgary] Gates does not control it," says Keith. </p>  <p>Recipients of the funding include Armand Neukermans, an inventor based in Silicon Valley who is working with colleagues to design spray systems for the marine clouds, and students and scientists working for Keith and Caldeira. Funding has also helped support scientific meetings in geoengineering in <a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2007/1109/1">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, and <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090429/full/4581097a.html">Edinburgh, Scotland</a>, and aeronautics research related to altering the stratosphere.</p>  <p>There are other grantees, Keith says, but he declined to identify them or say why. "This is like a little private funding agency," he says, though he says they plan to release more information. </p>  <p>Gates has shown interest in geoengineering research before. He is an investor in <a href="http://www.intellectualventures.com/">Intellectual Ventures</a>, a Seattle, Washington–area firm that pursues inventions and has applied for patents on <a href="http://intellectualventureslab.com/?p=296">techniques</a> to geoengineer the stratosphere. Along with officials from that organization, Gates applied for a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/16/bill-gates-envisions-figh_n_235527.html">patent</a> in 2008 to sap hurricanes of their strength by mixing surface and deep ocean water.</p>  <p>What's his ultimate goal? Gates "views geoengineering as a way to buy time but it's not a solution to the problem" of climate change, says spokesperson John Pinette. “Bill views this as an important avenue for research—among many others, including new forms of clean energy.” (Pinette works for BCG3, a think-tank type firm Gates started last year which has no apparent role thus far in supporting geoengineering.) “Scientific and technological advances are making it possible to solve big, complicated problems like never before,” <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/Pages/bill-melinda-gates-letter.aspx">writes</a> Gates on the Web site of the Gates Foundation, which is also not involved in the geoengineering work.</p>

At geoengineeringwatch.org it is stated that Bill Gates and Caldeira have filed for a joint patent. All the world should take that into consideration when looking into the ethics of all this. Caldeira has gone from science to money and that Genie aint ever going back into the bottle.

It also says that Caldeira doesn't advocate deployment. So patents are made by people who dont intend to use them?

There is a major crime going on here. Science is the same thinking that got our world into the tipping point on the cliff position we are in now. Einstein wouldn't have the problem solving the problem. 

Caldeira's WORDS are correct...we should not deploy. Thats where it ends. There will never be trust from humanity at this point...not to THESE people.

The message from science is so confused....we are warming, we aren't , we can spray the atmosphere, but we will lose the corals...

and even more troubling...our skies are SPRAYED EVERYDAY...Mr Caldeira doesn't seem to want to admit what half the world knows by now...Perhaps a third grade science student should teach him a little about contrails.

So why trust him...or any of them. They are arrogant beyond belief.

It is really quite simple: either we use geoengineering or come up with a cheap clean energy production technology.  If neither of those two things happen to prevent the carrying capacity of the Earth from falling dramatically, the human population will have to be culled, either deliberately or through a natural bottleneck.

We are indisputably into The Sixth Great Extinction, and preserving the Earth for future generations is BY FAR more important than the fate of the current generation of selfish mass murders who would rather destroy the Earth's ecosystems than change their self-destructive habits.

By the way, I am only stating the facts, not advocating any action.  There is only so much any one individual can do.

To characterize all of this research as "geoengineering" grossly distorts the breadth of work that Bill Gates has been kind and wise enough to support.

These funds are being used to support post-doc salaries, access to computational resources, and related research expenses. My salary is 100% supported by other sources of funds and none of my time has been billed to this account.

Furthermore, I have no formal control over any funds not directly supporting my group at the Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology. I have considered my role in the allocation of other funds as advisory.

the air force has been qouted in official government documents as stating," we own the weather". this brings to mind all the chemtrails(fake contrails) that are in our skies everywhere; they were not there some 30 years ago.(contrails were, but disapaited like they "normally should", not like the chemtrails that just spread out all over the skys now) any one interested in the real reason for chemtrails, google,"project blue beam" (not bluebook) also, a great read regarding controling the weather is, "angels dont play this h.a.a.r.p.", by nick begich.. people have collected the fallout of these  chemtrails/kind of web like/ and had it tested in labs.. contains high levels of aluminum and barium. much higher ppm that is safe for humans.. what are they doing???trailskore

Earlier this month, Spirit passed its sixth year exploring the red planet. But at a news conference today, wistful mission controllers announced what many had suspected: With two of its six wheels malfunctioning, Spirit is intractably stuck in loose soil in an area of Mars named Troy (see photo, left). There the rover will stay until its batteries die or its systems experience a catastrophic failure.If Spirit can survive the coming martian winter, it will begin functioning as a stationary platform, conducting science studies that had not been part of its original itinerary but will be important nevertheless.</p>  <p>"The most immediate issue is surviving the next martian winter," said John Callas, the mission's project manager of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Over the three past winters, mission controllers have been able to tilt the rover enough toward the sun to generate sufficient electrical power to keep its electronics from freezing to death. But now, in addition to being stuck in the sand—"like a golfer's worst nightmare," Callas said—Spirit is tilted 9 degrees away from sun. "We're clearly seeing a decrease in energy levels," he said. If that situation can't be improved, Spirit's power levels could drop below what's needed to continue operating, about 160 watt/hours per day.</p>  <p>Even if that happens, Callas explained, Spirit would go into what's called a low-power fault: All systems automatically shut down except for the rover's master clock. Then, each morning, Spirit would wake up slightly and check its power levels. If its batteries have accumulated enough charge, Spirit's radio would check in briefly with NASA. Otherwise, the rover would go back to sleep until the next day. This routine could persist for the next 6 months, Callas said, and controllers must be prepared not to hear from the rover for an extended period. </p> 
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
  <p>"We have hope that Spirit will survive the cold, dark winter," echoed Steve Squyres of Cornell University, principal investigator for both rover missions. When Spirit's six wheels were operating, he said, the rover team felt a "relentless imperative" to drive it. But now mission controllers must "focus on new classes of science," the most exciting of which is using Spirit's radio signal to track the motion of Mars both in its orbit and in its spin on its axis. That wobble, Squyres explained, reflects the martian internal structure. "If the core is made of iron, Mars will wobble one way; if it's liquid, it will wobble a different way." And by tracking the radio signal for the next 6 months or so, scientists think they can characterize the martian core. "We didn't think much about this at beginning of the mission," he said, "but now with a stationary rover we can focus on it."</p>  <p>Spirit can continue to serve science in two other ways, Squyres told reporters. First, its instruments can conduct the most intense study yet of the martian atmosphere. And second, it turns out that the place where Spirit got trapped is "extraordinarily rich" in sulfate salts—minerals that were ejected by hot, caustic steam vents. In addition, "when we look very carefully at soil we see evidence of layering," he said. That suggests thin films of water have formed at the location in the past, so studying the chemical composition can reveal much more about the martian past. "There's a really interesting story here," he said.</p>  <p>(Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)</p>

Colleagues remember <a href="http://today.caltech.edu/today/story-display?story_id=41582">Andrew Lange</a> as a brilliant scientist with a large streak of generosity. A Caltech cosmologist known for his work on the general geometry of the early universe, Lange took his own life on 22 January. He was 53. <br /><br />
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
Lawrence Wade, who had worked with Lange since 1993, recalls how Lange
would arrange for a postdoc to take all the equipment and the funding from
a project to help him get established as a new faculty member. “I don’t
know anybody else who is willing to give away a couple million dollars
worth of hardware and funding to help one of his former students,” says
Wade, a physicist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.<br /><br />Lange
was co-leader of an experiment that scored one of the bigger scientific
coups in recent decades. In 2000, the Balloon Observations of
Millimetric Extragalactic Radiation and Geophysics (BOOMERanG)
reported the first high-definition measurements of the afterglow of the
big bang, the so-called cosmic microwave background (CMB). The
temperature of that ancient radiation varies randomly by about one part
in 100,000 from point to point across the sky, and BOOMERanG was able
to measure the distribution of sizes of the hot and cold spots before
NASA launched its Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) to do
much the same thing.<br /><br />Reported in 2000, the BOOMERanG
measurements nailed the general “geometry” of the universe and its age
and, in concert with other measurements, gave the relative proportions
of ordinary matter, mysterious dark matter, and space-stretching dark
energy in the cosmos. WMAP mapped CMB across the entire sky and
measured all of those things to higher precision, but some cosmologists
say that BOOMERanG stole WMAP’s thunder. “WMAP only confirmed these
discoveries,” Wade says.<br /><br />“Some people thought he would have been
a candidate for a Nobel Prize,” says John Mather, a cosmologist at
NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who himself
won a Nobel Prize for measuring the spectrum of the microwaves in CMB. Lange was manifestly gifted, Mather says. Lange worked at
Goddard one summer as an undergraduate at Princeton University and “he stayed in
my basement,” Mather says. During his free time, Mather recalls, Lange
entertained himself reading <i>Gravitation</i> by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler,
a 1000-page tome on general relativity. “He was really an amazing
talent already.”<br /><br />John Ruhl, a cosmologist at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, recalls that Lange invited him
to work on BOOMERanG. “He kind of gave me my big break,” Ruhl says.
"The idea that he’s gone now is a hard hit.” Lange is survived by his
ex-wife, Frances Arnold, a Caltech biochemist, along with a stepson and
two sons.<br /><br />

The alternative would be a cap that covers only a portion of the electricity sector:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Graham’s comments seem to point to an alternative that’s been much-discussed recently: a scaled-back cap-and-trade program that would cover only the electricity sector.

<p>"Copenhagen"? Omitted. His pledge of "<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/11/25/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5774640.shtml">17% by 2020</a>"? No mention. Even "cap and trade" was left on the cutting-room floor for tonight's State of the Union address, if it was ever in there. In a speech squarely focused on jobs, Obama framed the climate bill as an essential element of an economic growth effort. Last year in his <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/25/full-text-barack-obama-congress-address">address to Congress</a>, he called for a "market-based cap," but this year he used vaguer language: a "comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives." Does his language suggest a willingness to sign a less forceful bill, <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/01/is-a-fulleconom.html">as some in the Senate want</a>? Perhaps. At the very least, it makes clear that Americans building solar panels and windmills will be the images Democrats will try to project as they push for a grand compromise in the Senate. And he included nods toward elements of that deal that would appeal to key fencesitters: nuclear power and offshore energy (the South), biofuels (farm states), and clean coal (rust belt):</p>
<blockquote><p>But to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives. That means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country. It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development. It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies. And yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America.</p><p>I am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year. </p></blockquote>

EXTENDED BODY:
<blockquote><p>This year, I am eager to help advance the bipartisan effort
in the Senate. I know there have been questions about whether we can
afford such changes in a tough economy; and I know that there are those
who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate
change. But even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for
energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our
future—because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be
the nation that leads the global economy. And America must be that

  <p>Climate researchers at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom broke the law by withholding data from public scrutiny, say <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jan/27/uea-hacked-climate-emails-foi">various</a> <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article7004936.ece">reports today</a>.

The Information Commissioner’s Office is assisting the police investigation with advice on data protection and freedom of information. </p>    <p>The emails which are now public reveal that Mr Holland’s requests under the Freedom of Information Act were not dealt with as they should have been under the legislation. Section 77 of the Freedom of Information Act makes it an offence for public authorities to act so as to prevent intentionally the disclosure of requested information. </p>    <p>Mr Holland’s FOI requests were submitted in 2007/8, but it has only recently come to light that they were not dealt with in accordance with the Act. The legislation requires action within six months of the offence taking place, so by the time the action taken came to light the opportunity to consider a prosecution was long gone. </p>    <p>The ICO is gathering evidence from this and other time-barred cases to support the case for a change in the law. It is important to note that the ICO enforces the law as it stands – we do not make it. It is for government and Parliament to consider whether this aspect of the legislation should be strengthened to deter this type of activity in future.</p>    <p>We will be advising the University about the importance of effective records management and their legal obligations in respect of future requests for information. We will also be studying the investigation reports (by Sir Muir Russell and Norfolk Police), and we will then consider what regulatory action, if any, should then be taken under the Data Protection Act.</p></blockquote>

You should not need an FOI to get the data that is used to back up a Scientific paper.

But then again, the CRU has not been practicing the scientific method for almost two decades. The scientific method requires that the researcher publish all the original data, models and procedures needed for a skeptical analysis of any of their work. Since they are not using the scientific method then they simply are not doing science, they are writing fiction.

Ponds and Fleishman may have been wrong about cold fusion, but they were at least real scientists. They did their experiments, published the results and their data, procedures and description of the apparatus and the methods. They where shown to be in error, fine, but they were still scientific in their work. The outputs from the CRU are in comparison junk, so I ask, why are these fictional 'research' papers allowed to remain in the realm of scientific publications? Why do people continue to quote the CRU as if they were the work of Albert Einstein rather than the work of Mark Twain?

<p>Undaunted by tight fiscal times, the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) is <a href="http://www.faseb.org/Portals/0/Content/Fed.Fund.rept.1.28.10.pdf">recommending</a> a whopping 19% increase, to $37 billion, for the 2011 budget of the National Institutes of Health. That's far more than the 7% or so that FASEB typically calls for and flies in the face of President Barack Obama's plan to freeze domestic discretionary spending.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>FASEB President Mark Lively explained the math today to reporters. The $6 billion boost takes into account the $10.4 billion in stimulus money that NIH received over 2 years, which will pump $4 billion into extramural research grants this year after infrastructure funds are subtracted. So FASEB is assuming NIH's current budget is $35 billion. Asking for a 5.7% boost, he said, will allow it to stay ahead of biomedical inflation (estimated at 3.3% in 2011).</p>
<p>The society is expecting NIH to get a "small increase" in the 2011 budget request to be released Monday, Lively says, making it an exception to what the Administration says will be a 3-year freeze on non-defense and entitlement programs. Congress typically sweetens the pot, and FASEB officials expect that to happen again. FASEB public affairs director Howard Garrison notes that NIH "has always had broad and strong support from a number of people in both houses" of Congress, including Senator Tom Harkin (D–IA) and Representative David Obey (D–WI), who chair the spending panels that oversee NIH's budget. Still, says Lively, "It's going to be a difficult year."</p>
<p>Another NIH booster, Research!America,&nbsp; has <a href="http://www.researchamerica.org/statement_10jan28_budget">urged</a> the president to request a 13% boost in 2011, to $35 billion.</p>

<p>R = Q x δ</p>
<p>Astronomer Ivan Almar suggests the brief formula above&nbsp;might help scientists decide how to tell the world that we are not alone in the universe. It’s a mathematical way of saying that the risk (R) associated with a possible discovery of extraterrestrial life is a combination of the danger of the life if it does exist (Q, which itself is the sum of several other factors such as what sort of life it is and how far it is away) and how likely the claim of its existence is to be true (δ). </p>
<p>It’s not the first time Almar has tried to mathematically quantify the search for extraterrestrial life. He’s one of the authors of the so-called <a href="http://www.setileague.org/iaaseti/rioscale.htm">Rio Scale</a>, a formula adopted by the International Academy of Astronautics to calculate the impact of publicly announcing that E. T. exists.</p>
<p>Almar presented his latest formula this week at the Royal Society in London as part of&nbsp;a <a href="http://royalsociety.org/Is-there-anybody-out-there/">2-day conference</a> grandly entitled “The detection of extra-terrestrial life and the consequences for science and society”. But one audience member suggested such a calculation was a waste of time because the public likely wouldn’t accept that they needn’t worry about a claimed detection of alien life simply because&nbsp;a formula indicated a risk of only three out of 10. </p>
<p>Such debates mixing science and speculation dominated the unusual Royal Society event.<br /></p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Topics ranged from the political (Vienna-based astrophysicict Mazlan Othman, who may have the best business card in the world as she is the director of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, discussed her duties and called for an international protocol on dealing with the possible detection of life in outer space) to the philosophical (theologian Ted Peters of University of California, Berkeley, discussed the significance of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life for the world’s religions) to the positively apocalyptic (astrophysicist Frank Drake, the original champion of the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence efforts, pondered whether a technologically advanced civilization would inevitably use its power to annihilate itself.).</p>
<p>Two of the most provocative speeches came from planetary scientist Christopher McKay of NASA Ames Research Center and physicist Paul Davies of Arizona State University. McKay suggested that the Viking Mars lander may have inadvertently oxidized any evidence of life it its samples of Martian soil, proposed an expedition to gather samples of water from the Saturn moon Enceladus, and offered a child-friendly analogy for how alien life might differ from life on Earth: “I could build a table out of Lincoln logs and you could build a table out of Legos: At the macroscopic scale they’d be the same—they’d both be tables; at the microscopic scale they’d be the same—they’d both be built from carbon atoms. In the middle, things would be different: one would be plastic and one would be wood. I think at the macroscopic scale any life we discover will have evolved by Darwinian evolution; at the microscopic scale it will be based on carbon chemistry. In the middle, at the level of biochemistry, I think there’s room for variation.” </p>
<p>Davies suggested that the “cosmic imperative,” the idea that, given favorable conditions, life would be bound to emerge, could be tested on Earth by looking for organisms unrelated to the currently known “tree of life.” He also speculated on how such a “shadow biosphere” might differ from ours and described efforts to find such organisms.</p>
<p>And the most entertaining? No contest. Paleobiologist Simon Conway Morris of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom began by suggesting that astrobiology might be considered “the study of that which does not exist.” He then went on to explain that survival in extreme circumstances can best be tested in dung heaps (“this may be why this field doesn’t attract many brilliant young scientists”) before suggesting that Darwinian evolution would inevitably favor organisms lacking altruism towards other species. His conclusion: “If the phone rings, whatever you do, do not pick it up!”<br /></p>

It is strange indeed that there was apparently no serious discussion of the enormous amount of data indicating aliens have been visiting Earth for a long time. There is however no evidence aliens have transmitted signals using techniques appropriate for our primitive technology. Multiple witness radar visual cases, physical trace cases, abductions provide far more data than theoretical discussions. These emperors clearly have no clothes and do have closed minds. Arrogance and ignorance have often in the past retarded technological progress.Too bad.

Perhaps humans represent the most advanced possible evolving life form and anyone else out there more advanced will be what I term an "engineered" life form and hence non-evolving in the darwinian sence of the word. Hence, unless engineered life forms actually want to design hate, destructiveness and agressiveness into themselves then we probably have little to fear. If all technologically advanced life begins engineering itself then I would expect the transition from evolving to engineered to operate like a feedback loop and occur nearly instantaneously at evolutionary time scales. Not only that but since the form of engineered life would depend only on physics then I believe that it's reasonable to expect all engineered forms to be the same regardless of what thier intial evolved form was.

There is one thing that kind of over shadows all of this "Do we let it ring?" question, and that is if we do by chance find that there is intelligent life beyond our solar system, that life would already know of our presence due to the fact that we have been sending radio transmissions which travel at the speed of light for over sixty years. By the time we confirm that there is indeed life elsewhere, they would know we exist, and they would know where we are. As far as the religious implications go, some religions would adopt this life as being created by God, but there would always be those die hard holy rollers that think God only created life for earth and that we are special. There would be panic on some scale, and panic drives fear which breeds hatred. Those who think that the world would be alright if we announced that E.T. exists are diluting themselves. There would be many fights about who is right, and the people who fear change the most would be the driving force behind those fights. Religious wars might break out, and if they do, it wouldn't matter that we had found E.T. because we would be too caught up in determining God's plan for us and the universe in general.

There tends to be a concern about whether or not world religions would be affected by an E.T. disclosure/visit. As ironic as it sounds religion is adaptive and would modify it's dogma to incorporate E.T. life. "God created them too" would be the justification and the religious would move on. Unless extra-terrestrials introduced (if they had one) their own religion......

   I would have to agree with Simon Conway Morris."If the phone rings let it go to the machine" While it may not be an exact Quote I think the principle is the same.
   I do however would question how long do we let it ring?Do we let it ring till it stops or at some point do we pull the plug from the wall which obviously would be the same as saying"Hello"

<p>After long and controversial discussions about merging with a university, Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, has decided to remain an independent institution. William Butler, BCM interim president, told faculty by e-mail yesterday that despite "financial difficulties" that led the school to consider joining with Rice University or Baylor University, BCM's board of trustees unanimously voted on Wednesday to "continue as an independent, autonomous institution." Many faculty members at nearby Rice fiercely opposed a merger and months of discussions ended 2 weeks ago. BCM officials then began exploring an alliance with Baylor University in Waco, but BCM faculty members, students, and alumni <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/01/turmoil-at-bayl.html">protested</a> that the Baptist university's religious mission was in conflict with that of the medical school.</p><p>The school will now develop "a long-range comprehensive strategy" that will be overseen by a manager to be appointed at the request of creditors, Butler's message says. BCM will also begin searching for a new president.</p>

  <p>They see it as an attempt to undermine a program that biomedical lobbyists have complained is supporting low-quality research at a time when excellent proposals from top scientists are being rejected for lack of funds.

NIH officials <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/10/landrieu-the-bu.html">testified this fall</a> that they plan to spend roughly $200 million this year on programs that support small businesses.</p>  <p>The legislation is part of a broader effort to support small businesses.

B. Esaf:  Regarding ARRA you have hit the nail squarely on the head.  A state of Texas sponsored program that has raped the taxpayers of the state called the Cancer Prevention Research Institute has essentially done the same thing.  The problem is that biomedical lobbyist, government officials and even the farce called the peer review system comprised of so-called scientists could not recognize low quality from high quality science or top versus mediocre scientists if they jumped up and bit them in the rear.

High quality science and top scientists are defined by false superficial utilitarian metrics the same way athletes are judged, that is small incremental quantity bytes rather than overall quality, incremental generation of bits of data equivalent to batting averages for a baseball player, and salesmanship and inflated self-promotion equivalent to a popular politician or Hollywood celebrity.

No small part of the problem is that conceptual causation basic research has been hijacked by applications, so-called "translational research," correlation sociology like epidemiology, and giant operations of empirical database generation like genome sequencing.  This empiricism that is taking a major part of scarce resources needed for basic sciences neither has to answer to the rigorous criteria of concept hypothesis rationale real basic research nor the milestones required for true translational or applications research like SBIR and other goal oriented activity measured by profit and jobs.

The most powerful lobbyists represent these hijackers at the expense of both the most fundamental basic research sciences and true milestone-based programs like SBIR.

Did the ARRA stimulus just make the rich richer? -- I've spoken with many of my academic friends who reported that investigators who were already well-funded by NIH got <em>even more funding</em> via ARRA. NIH's strategy for distributing ARRA monies seems to have been betting on "sure things," that is funneling the funds to established academic investigators that had already been vetted by NIH's legendarily risk-averse grant review system. Surely some of the stimulus money could have been invested in SBIR applicants with the potential to create real <em>jobs in self-sustaining, private sector companies</em>.

<p>Philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates called on the world today to launch a "decade of vaccines" that would dramatically reduce childhood mortality in poor countries—and they pledged to raise their own foundation's outlays on vaccine research, development, and delivery by 25%, to a total of $10 billion over the next decade. “We’ve made vaccines our number-one priority at the Gates Foundation because we’ve seen firsthand their incredible impact on children’s lives,” Melinda Gates said today at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>The couple cited recent advances in childhood vaccine development and delivery that have already saved millions of lives. For instance, thanks to improved basic health care programs,&nbsp;79% of children in developing nations now get all three doses of the vaccine that protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. A computer model developed by researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, shows that pushing that number up to 90% would save an additional 7.6 million lives between now and 2020.</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2010/01/gates_foundation_pledges_10_bi.html">interview</a> with NPR, Bill Gates says he wants to bring vaccination rates for measles, Haemophilus influenza type B, pneumococcal disease, and rotavirus—which causes diarrhea—to similar levels. Rapidly introducing a reasonably efficacious malaria vaccine,&nbsp;such as one&nbsp;now in phase III clinical trials, starting in 2014, would save another 1.1 million lives, according to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which also will support the development of new vaccines, for instance against tuberculosis.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The Gates Foundation has spent some $4.5 billion on vaccine research, development, and delivery since its inception in 1994. The past couple of years, its outlays for vaccines were some $800 million annually, a foundation spokesperson says. The new initiative will raise that to $1 billion annually.</p>  <p>The Gates's call was met with enthusiastic reactions from global health leaders—but some stressed that even more is needed. Margaret Chan, the director-general of the World Health Organization, called the announcement "unprecedented" in a written <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2010/gates_gavi_20100129/en/index.html">statement</a>, but added that it's "absolutely crucial that both governments and the private sector step up efforts" as well. "When the Gates Foundation acts, people listen," <a href="http://www.sabin.org/pressroom/sabin_news/2010/01/29/sabin-vaccine-institute-praises-gates-foundation-investment-vaccines">said</a> Peter Hotez, president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington, D.C. "This announcement will ... hopefully, encourage others to invest in vaccine development, research and education."</p>

True, but often the driver of child malnutrition is sick parents.  Getting parents healthy so they can consistently provide food for their children is a big first step.

If Bill and Melinda Gates want to wage an assault on child mortality, why not take aim at its most significant cause?  Hunger and malnutrition are the biggest causes of child mortality in developing countries.  An estimated 6 million children under the age of five starve to death every year.

<p>Federal budget day has dawned on Washington, D.C., and the numbers the Administration is proposing for 2011 are coming in fast and furious. <i>Science</i>'s team of reporters will be posting items throughout the day as we analyze the numbers, so be sure to keep coming back to Insider.</p>
<p>An early eyebrow-raiser? President Barack Obama wants to spend $300 million next year on the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), the blue-sky science arm of the Department of Energy (DOE). The 3-year-old agency got off to a fast start with $400 million of Recovery Act money to spend in 2009 and 2010. But Congress has yet to bestow any funds on ARPA-E through the normal appropriations process, so it's unclear how lawmakers will respond to Obama's proposal to give so much to the new agency. The $300 million for ARPA-E in such a tough overall budget environment means that Energy Secretary Steve Chu has successfully shepherded the program through the Office of Science and Technology Policy and White House budgeteers, which is no small feat. Also impressive for Chu: DOE's Office of Science would get a 4.6% increase in 2011, to $5.12 billion. The money would fund a gaggle of programs at U.S. universities and the national labs. </p>
<p>With budget austerity a main theme both for the White House and the Democrat-controlled Congress, the normal caveat—that these numbers are just a proposal that lawmakers must approve or alter—is more important than ever this year.</p>

<p>As many had expected, President Barack Obama has proposed <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6101XF20100201">terminating NASA's human space-flight program</a>. Instead, the Administration's 2011 budget would provide money to the private sector for developing commercial spacecraft for space exploration. The decision will signal the end of the Constellation program, which was initiated by the previous Administration with the goal of returning American astronauts to the moon by 2020. The Administration appears to have paid heed to a <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/10/no-nasa-augusti.html">report delivered by the Augustine commission</a> last fall which said that NASA would not be able to continue with its human space-flight program without a boost of $3 billion a year. Under current budgetary constraints, that seemed like an impossible target. Stay tuned for more details. </p>

<p>Wow. A first, quick look at what President Barack Obama wants to spend next year on science shows across-the-board increases for research and training. Those gains come despite the president's plan to freeze domestic discretionary programs in hopes of reducing a $1.4 trillion deficit.</p>
<p>Here's some of what the president's $3.8 trillion 2011 budget request, submitted this morning, could mean for science, if Congress were to go along:</p>
<ul><li>A $1 billion increase, to $32.1 billion, for the National Institutes of Health. That 3%-plus boost is aimed at keeping NIH on pace with inflationary costs for doing biomedical research.</li><li>A $550 million boost, to $7.4 billion, for the National Science Foundation. Almost all of that 8% increase would go to NSF's six research directorates, with a special emphasis on clean energy and sustainability. Its education and training programs would rise by 2%.</li><li>A $226 million hike, to $5.1 billion, for the Office of Science within the Department of Energy (DOE). The department's 3-year-old effort to jump-start a low-carbon economy, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, would get $300 million as its first annual budget. A scaled-down education and training initiative, RE-ENERGYSE, would get $74 million, after Congress rejected a much larger program proposed last year. </li><li>A $540 million boost, to $5 billion, for science programs within NASA. The increase comes as part of the Administration's proposed reshuffling of priorities on human space exploration. That plan includes a heavy-lift rocket for exploration beyond the moon and the commercial sector taking on responsibility for getting astronauts to the low-Earth-orbit international space station.</li><li>A $164 million jump, to $429 million, in the competitively awarded research programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</li><li>A $67 million increase, to $587 million, for the basic science programs at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</li></ul><p>
NIST is one of three agencies—NSF and DOE's Office of Science round out the trio—that have been promised a doubled research budget over 10 years. The Administration's 2011 budget for all three is in line with that pledge.</p><p>[Jennifer Couzin-Frankel adds this about CDC: The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention suffered a slight drop; in its 2009 budget CDC
received $6.36 billion, and Obama is now requesting $6.34 billion.
That’s also $125 million less the current estimated budget for 2010 <strike>than he requested last year</strike>. CDC's flat budget is due to unspent flu money.<br /></p><p>&nbsp;<br />The Administration proposes eliminating CDC's anthrax vaccine activities, 
which began in 1999.&nbsp; According to the budget, "The program has achieved its 
goals of reducing the number of vaccine doses, simplifying the administration 
route, and conducting long-term safety surveillance."&nbsp; Cutting the program would 
trim $3 million from CDC's 2011 budget. ]<br /><br /> </p>

I am a practicing medical oncologist that has merged clinical care of the patient with ongoing research and publication in the peer-reviewed literature. I would unhesitatingly consider myself as intensely pro-research.  Yet, I consider the moves by the current administration insofar as the budgetary allowances to the scientific community to be brazenly reckless, and not something that we in the scientific community should be happy about. It is not great that our budget was not cut for it indicates that the psychotic behavior of those in office has continued.  

Yes, the spree spending by Obama and the current administration may be a great relief to those in science but how can any rationale being condone such behavior when it is but a pseudo short-term fix with long-term catastrophic ramifications for our children and grandchildren.  How is this any different from the issues involved in the housing scandals with banks loaning money to those without decent credit?  Obama & company keep on printing money with no backing and our dollar has become tremendously devalued.  Money that has been hard earned by citizens is doled out without accountability.  Foreign aid, expenditures conducting two wars, maintaining military bases all over the world, and even a disproportional amount of aid to Haiti continues, while our infrastructure is fractured.  The rest of the civilized world is not sharing in the expenses, but we here in America, with a seemingly endless supply of money have our elected officials continue to spend like a drunk on a binge.   

All of us, scientists and those in every walk of productive life in this country should be calling for every possible action that will eliminate further behavior which is evidently irresponsible and without accountability. Many of you will not like to hear this opinion but it is based on harsh reality and not some Disneyland fantasy.  We should all be madder than hell at how our ship is being run. It is clearly not a taut ship. An excerpt from Rear Admiral Arleigh Burke, USN, is appropriate to this issue: 

"Slackness in Command. All major catastrophies in the loss of discipline in all organizations have been preceded by a general slackness in the command. The old saying that a taut ship is a happy ship is still true. The reason is that on a taut ship the officers and the men know where they stand and what is expected of them. There can be complete dependence on one's associates, for lack of reliability will be brought up with a round turn. On such ships, all men do a day's work, not just the conscientious ones. There are no soft billets in a taut outfit. The officers and the men are on the job and require others to be on the job. Chiselers and transgressors are promptly punished while their offenses are still minor.    

Our ship of State is capsizing and those in the oval office are not doing their job. There is slackness in our command in the White House and in D.C.  Of all the citizens in this country, we scientists should be bright enough to see the forest for the trees.

For those of us who are starting new businesses in the Bio tech Medical Technology areas, this is very encouraging news.  The Venture Capital industry has turned their backs on early stage ventures in science and medicine because of 1. time to market is too long, 2. Regulatory Risk is too high, as is evidenced by the FDA CDRH panels that have simply asked for more data when no more data was necessary, and in the process killed the startup, 3. reimbursement risk is too high, (CMS / insurance is not going to pay for a high device cost) 4. Comparative Effectiveness is an unknown at this point, etc.  Because of this, we need to approach the gov't for grant monies, and this is where the startups are going to have to live for the time being.

  <p>In remarks on the budget this morning yet to be posted online, President Barack Obama made clear why science fares well in an otherwise austere budget year:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>We also continue to lay a new foundation for lasting growth, which is essential as well.&nbsp; Just as it would be a terrible mistake to borrow against our children's future to pay our way today, it would be equally wrong to neglect their future by failing to invest in areas that will determine our economic success in this new century.</p>    <p>That's why we build on the largest investment in clean energy in history, as well as increase investment in scientific research, so that we are fostering the industries and jobs of the future right here in America.</p>    <p>That's why I've proposed a more than 6 percent increase in funding for the Education Department.&nbsp; And this funding is tied to reforms that raise student achievement, inspire students to excel in math and science, and turn around failing schools which consign too many young people to a lesser future—because in the 21st century there is no better anti-poverty program than a world-class education.</p></blockquote>

BODY:

<p><b>SÃO PAULO—</b>Big Oil is making one of its biggest biofuel investments to date with a $12 billion venture here that joins a major petroleum company with an ethanol producer. Cosan, Brazil’s largest biofuels maker, <a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/01/shell-to-join-brazils-cosan-in-ethanol-joint-venture/">said today</a> that it <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-02-01/shell-cosan-plan-ethanol-fuel-distribution-venture-in-brazil.html">will merge its 23 ethanol-producing sugarcane mills</a> with Royal Dutch Shell’s network of 2740 domestic gas stations. Research into a next-generation fuel—cellulosic ethanol from sugarcane—may have played a critical role in shaping the deal.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Until recently, Shell had been pooh-poohing ethanol, saying it didn’t plan to dive into production until more efficient, second-generation technologies came online. Following that strategy, Shell invested heavily in biotechnology companies like Ottawa, Canada-based Iogen Corp., which is developing cellulosic ethanol technology, and Codexis Inc. of Redwood City, California, a start-up that uses molecular methods.</p>
<p>Now, in a little noted part of the Cosan deal, Shell will roll its shares of Codexis and Iogen into the new Brazilian joint venture. Shell executive Mark Williams said in a press conference that the deal “is a big opportunity to accelerate the deployment of advanced processes.” The reason: Brazil’s sugarcane mills produce huge quantities of cheap cellulose in the form of sugarcane straw, a byproduct. And it isn’t just Shell eyeing those convenient piles of cellulose. Industry sources
say many next-generation biofuels start-ups have been poking around Brazil.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Brazilian companies are in need of new technology. For all its prowess in making cheap ethanol, Brazil, which spends relatively little on R&amp;D, has fallen behind in the race to convert cellulose to fuel. “Iogen is pretty advanced in the conversion of cellulose,” Marcos Lutz, president of Cosan, said during a press conference in São Paulo. “The relevance to us is we have a lot of cellulose.” </p>

Great consolidating move for Cosan and Shell. The $12B investment in biofuels will definitely boost Shell’s global operations and promote biofuel in Brazil.

<p>The Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Office of Science gets a healthy $226 million funding increase, to $5.12 billion, in the proposed 2011 budget. The lion’s share of the 4.6% increase would be go to the basic energy sciences (BES) office, which funds research into condensed matter physics, materials science, chemistry, and related fields and runs DOE’s x-ray synchrotrons and other user facilities. BES’s budget climbs from $1.637 billion to $1.835 billion, an increase of $198 million or 12.1%.</p><p>In contrast, funding for DOE’s fusion energy sciences (FES) program gets clipped from an estimated $426 million this year to a requested $380 million next year, a reduction of 10.8%. That reduction would come out of the United States’s contribution to the international fusion experiment, ITER, which will be built in Cadarache, France. Under the
proposed budget, ITER would get $80 million next year, down from an estimated $135 million this year. The decrease marks the latest dip on the ITER budget roller coaster. In 2008, Congress zeroed out $150 million of spending on ITER in a squabble with the White House. The project got $124 million the following year.</p> 
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Ironically, the current cut comes about because ITER itself has slowed down as researchers contend with design revisions that could double its $7 billion price tag. “We need to make sure that we don’t get ahead of the project as a whole,” says Thom Mason, director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, home of the U.S. ITER project office. The proposed $80 million would keep U.S. researchers fully engaged next year, Mason says. However, he worries that the dip this
year will make the required funding increases in 2012 and beyond all the larger and harder to achieve.</p>
<p>The boost for BES is what observers expected, given Secretary of Energy Steven Chu’s goal of making the Office of Science more relevant to the world’s looming energy problem. The funding increase “is in the area where an Administration interested in energy might make its investments,” says Persis Drell, director of SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, California, which gets most of its funding through the BES program. BES will get $34 million for a new Energy
Innovation Hub—a free-wheeling research center modeled after the Bell Labs of old—that will focus on batteries and energy storage. DOE proposed eight hubs last year, but Congress funded only three of them. "If you don't have [the storage technology], the other technologies would become moot," says Hector Abruña, a chemist at Cornell University.</p>
<p>The Office of Science's four other programs are slated to get smaller increases: The high energy physics budget edges up 2.3% to $829 million, the nuclear physics budget climbs 5.0% to $562 million, biological and environmental science rises 3.8% to $627 million, and spending on advanced scientific computing research jumps by 8.1% to $426 million.</p>

We need to get these funding issues into the mainstream and have the source of the lobbying efforts disclosed and scutinized.  If it were not for the billion$ that the major oil companies and foriegn interests have invested in delaying this research, we would have solved the technical issues and harnassed fusion energy already.
The research being done at ORNL in support of ITER and the projects at LLNL and other places in support of competing approaches all need to have reliable funding channeled toward them.  These projects take decades, and without sustained support, the best and brightest will move on to other areas of research or move to private industry.
I'm not saying "give them everything they want times 2", but a scientific approach not influenced by lobbying efforts at crossed purpose would at least allow science to deliver on its promise...

<p>The Smithsonian Institution, home to 500 scientists and an 
equal number of research fellows, today received a promise of a boost for the four 
grand challenges launched in its September 2009 <a href="http://si.edu/about/documents/SI_Strategic_Plan_Exec_Summary2010-2015.pdf">strategic 
plan</a>. Most notably, the total proposed budget of $797.6 million includes $10 million 
for the strategic plan. Of that, $8 million would  go toward promoting biodiversity and 
climate change research. These funds signal increased recognition of the need to 
support programmatic activities at the Smithsonian and not just bricks and 
mortar, says Scott Miller, the Smithsonian’s deputy undersecretary for science.
</p><p>Within the $8 million, the <a href="http://www.ctfs.si.edu/">Center for 
Tropical Forest Science</a>, based in Panama, is slated to receive $2 million to 
expand its long-term studies of forest plots around the world. The center got 
$1.25 million last year, the only science program to be singled out for support 
in the Smithsonian's 2010 budget. <br /></p><p>If another proposed $1 million in the new budget is  approved, the Smithsonian 
will begin to set up a parallel long-term program in the sea by establishing 
marine “plots” in Panama, Florida, and Belize that will become long-term study 
sites. 
</p><p>Another $1 million will support <a href="http://www.barcoding.si.edu/DNABarCoding.htm">DNA barcoding</a>, a 
short-cut way to identify species. The proposed budget also includes $1 
million for the <a href="http://www.eol.org/">Encyclopedia of Life</a> project 
and $2 million for biodiversity research across the Smithsonian.
</p><p>As for bricks and mortar items, the <a href="http://www.serc.si.edu/">Smithsonian Environmental Research Center</a> in 
Edgewater, Maryland, hopes to be swapping out temporary labs based in trailers 
in a parking lot for new lab space if $16 million of the $40 million total cost 
is approved. And there’s $7 million for renovations at the <a href="http://www.stri.org/">Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute</a> in 
Panama. 
</p><p>Overall, the proposed Smithsonian budget of $797.6 million is an increase from the 
FY 2010 budget of $761.4 million and includes $660.8 million for salaries and 
expenses and $136.8 for facilities.

<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration could get a substantial boost if Congress approves President Barack Obama's 2011 request for a 23% increase over its current budget, to a shade over $4 billion. Most of the increase—$601 million—would come from user fees charged to the drug, device, tobacco, and other companies regulated by FDA, which have supplied FDA with billions of dollars in recent years. Another $146 million would come from the federal government. Like any federal support, the user fee increases require congressional approval.</p>
<p>FDA’s priorities under its new director, Margaret Hamburg, have four headings: The biggest is food safety, garnering an increase of $318 million. Much of that will go towards implementing recommendations from the <a href="http://www.foodsafetyworkinggroup.gov/">President’s Food Safety Working Group</a>, created last spring to bolster food safety and make outbreaks of food-borne illnesses less likely. The recommendations include improved the tracing of foods to pinpoint where illnesses like salmonella originated, and more audits and inspections of facilities.</p>
<p>The agency has also been promised an extra $101 million to help improve the safety of drugs, devices, blood, and medical therapies, including efforts to bolster safety of cord blood and human tissue for transplant. Five million dollars is slated to expand postmarketing surveillance of products already approved for sale.</p><p>FDA is also seeking $215 million, all in fees from tobacco companies, to help <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/06/fda-to-expand-w.html#more">regulate tobacco products</a>, and $25 million for a “new generation of medical technologies,” said Hamburg in a press briefing this afternoon. Those could make it easier for the agency to assess therapies that touch on personalized medicine, nanotechnology, regenerative medicine, and other cutting edge areas.</p>

</p><p>Competitive grants are catching on at two agencies—the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency—that haven't been big investors in such awards in the past.</p><p>
</p><p>At USDA,  the competitive grants program would get a $167 million boost, rising by 64% to $429 million. "It's a remarkable confirmation of the importance that the president and the secretary place on competitive research," says Roger Beachy, who heads the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the home for extramural funding at USDA. By contrast USDA's grants given via so-called formula funding to universities would remain flat, as would the NIFA overall budget of $1.5 billion. The Agricultural Research Service, which performs intramural research at USDA, would decline $51 million, to $1.2 billion.</p><p>[<b>UPDATE: </b>Here's a sharper focus on ARS, courtesy of USDA's Rick Borchelt. He notes that the research
portion of the ARS 2011 budget request is $20 million higher than in FY 2010. The agency is requesting
$61.5 million to create or expand research initiatives, while
eliminating $75 million of unspent funds for facilities.]</p><p>
</p><p>Advocates of agricultural research are focusing on the big win of the day for competitive research. "It's pretty incredible number," says Karl Glasener, who is based in Washington, D.C., directs science policy for the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. He attributes the jump to the efforts of Rajiv Shah, who oversaw USDA research until he was sworn in as head of the U.S. Agency for International Development last month. Glasener is also encouraged that the president's science adviser, John Holdren, mentioned NIFA in a White House briefing. "We've never had energy like this in the agricultural sciences," Glasener says. "I don't recall a science adviser ever mentioning agriculture in a budget briefing."</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>USDA wants to pay for the increase by cutting out congressional earmarks—rarely a successful approach on Capitol Hill. Beachy says he plans to include many of those research areas in request for proposals; there will be fewer, but larger, grants than in the past. "We hope
there's some understanding in Congress that the best way to move the country and regions forward is through these larger grants that we're awarding," Beachy says. "We think we'll get more bang for the buck."</p><p>Meanwhile EPA is proposing a 40% increase for its competitive grants program. The Science To Achieve Results (STAR) program would get $87.2 million in 2011, a $25.2 million boost from this year's budget. One component of the program, STAR grants to graduate students, would rise by $6.2 million to a proposed level of $17.3 million, which would fund an additional
240 fellowships.</p><p>That represents a big increase, considering the overall science and
technology budget is essentially flat, at a request of $846.7 million. Within EPA in-house research, however, computational toxicology would receive an increase of $1.9 million, growing the program to $21.9 million with a focus on accelerating the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program. EPA appears to be paying for these increases mainly by stripping out congressional earmarks and reducing its homeland security program.</p><p>[<b>UPDATE: </b>Taking a finer look at EPA reveals a slightly different
picture. While the broad science and technology account is flat, the
research slice of that pie would grow 4.9%, to $553 million, according
to figures (<a href="http://www.ostp.gov/galleries/press_release_files/OSTP%20Budget%20Release.pdf">pdf</a>) from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.]</p>

BODY:

<p>According to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Steven Chu, DOE will abandon its plan to store spent fuel from nuclear reactors and other high-level nuclear waste in an underground repository in Yucca Mountain in Nevada. At a briefing on the proposed 2011 federal budget today in Washington, D.C., Chu announced that DOE will withdraw its application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a license to build the repository. The decision ends a decades-long controversy that began when Congress chose the site in 1987 and politicians and denizens of Nevada began to fight the plan.</p><p>“It’s not a major surprise, but until they did this, Yucca Mountain was still by law the repository for high-level nuclear waste,” in the United States, says Thomas Isaacs, a nuclear engineer and expert on nuclear policy at Stanford University. Even before he was elected, President Barack Obama had said that Yucca Mountain was not an option for a nuclear repository, says Isaacs, who was involved in the search for suitable sites for such a repository.</p><p>So many things went wrong in the development of the plans for the Yucca Mountain site that, “you can point your finger in any direction and find someone to blame,” Isaacs says. One major problem, he says, was that the federal law mandating the development of the repository was so rigid that it left DOE little flexibility to work with the local community and the State of Nevada. “It was so explicit that it made it very difficult for the program to operate in a manner that was going to build the kind of trust that will last for the decades it takes to complete one of these projects.”</p><p>Still, Isaacs says he’s optimistic that a site for a repository can be found, noting that one for lower-level waste—such as contaminated gloves and booties from defense facilities—was successfully sited in Carlsbad, New Mexico. DOE has formed a blue-ribbon panel to consider the issue of managing high-level waste. However, at the briefing, Chu said that the panel would focus on broad waste issues; it is not charged with picking a new repository site.</p>

<p>National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins says he's pleased with the $1 billion raise, to $32.1 billion, that NIH is slated to get in the president's 2011 budget. It may be a modest 3.2% raise, but aside from the $10.4 billion NIH got last year in Recovery Act money, the $1 billion is the largest increase proposed by the Administration for NIH in 8 years. "It could have been a lot worse," Collins says. "Clearly, this is a difficult time budgetarily. I am grateful that I work for a president who ... has been able to give support to science not just at NIH but across many agencies as well."</p>  <p>Groups such as the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) are applauding, too. Most of NIH's 27 institutes and centers will receive increases ranging between 2.5% and 3.6%. </p>  <p>The details, Collins says, reflect five themes that he laid out last year: genomics, translational research, health care reform, global health, and reinvigorating the biomedical community. It’s a coincidence, he says, that these priorities led to disproportionate boosts for two diseases that the Obama Administration singled out for attention before Collins took the NIH helm last summer: cancer (up 4.4% to $6.036 billion) and autism (up 5%, to $142 million as part of a $222 million initiative spanning the Department of Health and Human Services).</p> 
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
  <p> Although NIH directors generally don't like being told to spend money on specific diseases, Collins says his "science-based budgeting" found that these two areas were "particularly well primed for investments," especially in genomics: Along with funding cancer and autism clinical trials, NIH plans to expand its cancer genome atlas and sequence the entire genomes of 300 autism patients and their parents. "It's driven by science," he says.</p>  <p>The budget will also double, to $50 million, a program Collins helped launch as genome institute director to develop drugs for rare and neglected diseases; put $20 million into OppNet, a new cross-NIH initiative on behavioral and social sciences research; add $22 million to nanotechnology health research, a 6% boost to $382 million; and contribute $33 million to building a Department of Energy synchrotron.</p>  <p>But largely because of these priorities, the news isn't good for scientists competing for NIH's individual investigator awards. The pot of money for new and competing extramural grants will fall 0.3% to roughly $4 billion, and the number of these grants will drop by 199 to 9052. And demand for grants could soar because of the many scientists who received temporary, 2-year funding through the $8.2 billion for extramural research that NIH received in the Recovery Act.</p>  <p>Indeed, Collins expects success rates—the chances that a submitted application will be funded—to slide in 2011. "Frankly, we are going to have to do great science under challenging circumstances," Collins says. FASEB President Mark Lively praised the $1 billion boost but <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/01/faseb-says-nih.html">suggests</a> that NIH actually needs six times that much to maintain momentum from the Recovery Act money. Otherwise, "we're not going to be able to continue the benefits" from the stimulus, Lively says. </p>

The following is the original and current mission statement for NIH: "NIH is the steward of medical and behavioral research for the Nation. Its mission is science in pursuit of FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE NATURE AND BEHAVIOR OF LIVING SYSTEMS and the application of that
knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability."(my emphasis in capital letters.) What is missing from Collins' five themes?  Little by little, the US cedes the discovery potential of fundamental biological knowledge overseas.

  <p>With the Obama Administration continuing to push for funding in clean energy, green manufacturing, and advances in health care, the National Institute of Standards and Technology finds itself in the welcome position of trying to grease the wheels of all three. NIST works to forge common standards and measurement tools for everything from the weight of a kilogram to the best way to make cell-derived drugs. Those common standards are critical to pushing the growth of new industries, says NIST Director Patrick Gallagher. Case in point, Gallagher says, is so-called “smart grid” technology that's designed to integrate renewable power coming from wind turbines and solar cells with the nation's 9000 conventional power plants and 300,000 miles of transmission lines. Other NIST programs that got a favorable nod: green manufacturing (+$10 million), cyber security (+$10 million), disaster resilient buildings (+$5 million), and measurement and standards for manufacturing biologics, or cell-derived drugs (+$10 million). </p>  <p>With these and other additions, the Administration proposes increasing the budget for NIST's National Scientific and Technical Research and Services, which includes NIST's in house research labs, by 13%, to $584 million.</p>

  <p> Construction money for lab upgrades is forecasted to decline $22 million compared with last year. But that is with last year's $47 million in Congressional earmarks zeroed out, a block of funds Congress is apt to restore. A final winner again this year is NIST's Technology Innovation Program, the successor to the controversial Advanced Technology Program, which congress almost killed during the previous Administration. Here the Administration proposes boosting funding $10 million, to $79 million.&nbsp; </p>  <p>Collectively, the additions bring NIST's FY 2011 budget request to $919 million, up 7.3%. That's also a raise of nearly 22% since 2008, and keeps NIST on a path to doubling its budget by 2017. "We're overjoyed with the budget," Gallagher says. "It shows that science and technology are really viewed through an economic lens." </p>

BODY:
  <p>With all the single and double digit budget increases among science programs and agencies in this year's budget, new funds for the National Nanotechnology Initiative look comparatively meager. NNI is an amalgam of the nanotechnology research budgets within the 25 participating agencies. Overall, that collective research budget request is essentially unchanged from what the agencies were given for FY 2010, though it is up about 5% from the Administration's request last year of $1.7 billion. But drill down a bit and the pots of money are shifting. The big winner?</p> 
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
  <p> The Department of Energy, which would see its nano budget increase 17% to $438 million to fund projects such as using nanotechnology to improve solar cells. The National Institutes of Health and other agencies within Health and Human Services also received a healthy boost, up 9.5%, to $414 million. Two agencies (the Food and Drug Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission) also look to get into the nano-research game for the first time, though likely with just a few million dollars. </p>  <p>In contrast, the Department of Defense saw its nano research budget slashed by 20%, to $349 million. Much of that could find its way back in, however, since most of those cuts came from previous Congressional earmarks.</p>  <p>Environmental health and safety (EHS) research also fared well this go around. EHS research studies the environmental and health impacts of nanomaterials. The United States already spends more money on EHS research than the rest of the world combined. The Obama Administration is looking to extend that lead, with its proposal to increase EHS research to $119 million, an increase of 35% over last year's request. "Overall, I'm pleased to see energy, innovation technology, and environmental health and safetey research moving forward," says Clayton Teague, who heads the National Nanotechnology Coordination office in Arlington, Virginia, which coordinates research among the NNI's participating agencies. </p>

BODY:
  <p>By canceling NASA’s moon mission, launched by former President George W. Bush in 2004, the White House pays heed to a report delivered last fall by the Norm Augustine commission, which declared that the goal of returning American astronauts to the moon by 2020 was unviable without a major boost to NASA’s budget. Instead, the White House has proposed eliminating the Constellation program, a $3.5-billion-a-year initiative aimed at building rockets, spacecraft, and other systems for the moon mission. </p>  <p>Although the moon mission would be zeroed out under the Administration’s proposal, NASA’s overall budget would increase by $6 billion over the next 5 years. It would go from $18.7 billion in 2010 to $19 billion in 2011. </p>  <p>NASA officials argue that Constellation’s end marks a major change in the nation’s space policy that could in fact accelerate space exploration by freeing up money for science and the funding of new technologies for future space flight, which would be led by the private sector instead of the government. NASA officials say they will leverage corporate investments and international collaborations to chart a new course in space exploration. That includes putting up money to extend the life of the international space station beyond the current end date of 2015 to at least 2020.</p>  <p>The good news for researchers is that the Administration’s proposed funding for science would climb to $5 billion in 2011 from a current level of $4.45 billion, although details on what new programs would be supported have yet to become clear. </p>

EXTENDED BODY:
  <p>“The number seems consistent with Obama’s stated commitment to science,” says David Leckrone, former chief scientist of the Hubble Space Telescope, who retired from NASA last fall. He says Charles Bolden, as the new administrator, deserves credit for seeing through an overall increase in the agency’s budget. “I’d have to give him good marks for coming away with a significant increase at a time of severe budgetary constraints,” Leckrone says. “It’s a coup, and I believe that Charlie had a major role in making that happen.”</p>  <p>The Augustine commission found that “key milestones” of Constellation “were slipping, and that the program would not get us back to the moon in any reasonable time or within any affordable cost,” Bolden told reporters at a press conference after the budget was rolled out. He said the Administration’s budget proposal for NASA provides “$4.9 billion over 5 years for a broad space-technology program, including investments in very early stage and game-changing approaches” that would serve as a catalyst for commercial space flights. </p>  <p>It remains to be seen if Congress will agree with the proposed termination of the Constellation program, which is a source of jobs in Florida, Alabama, and a few other states. Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) has vowed to fight the cut, and more political opposition is sure to follow. Others—notably, members of the Augustine panel—are pleased. “This brings NASA back to its roots as an engine of innovation,” says Sally Ride, an astronaut who served on the commission. </p>

An ESO team is currently studying a number of potential sites for the E-ELT and will report back to the ESO Council in March. The European Parliament does not have any jurisdiction over ESO because the organization is funded directly by its 14 member states, not via the 27-member European Union, but that will not stop politicians trying to influence where the estimated €1 billion needed to build E-ELT is spent.</p>

<p>Researchers at Italy's main environmental research institute have stopped <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/12/dont-shoot-rese.html">their rooftop protest</a>, but they're still dissatisfied with job promises from Italian Minister of the Environment Stefania Prestigiacomo. The minister lured down the protesters from the Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA) with a promised meeting, and in an agreement signed on 20 January, she pledged to renew all threatened contracts for 1 year and to appoint new positions in the near future. But that pledge apparently covers just 200 contracts out of 450 lost positions at ISPRA, as the minister plans to only renew contracts that expired on 31 December 2009. And the renewals are for just 1 year—the researchers had asked for 3-year contracts at a minimum. Some of the researchers at ISPRA say they are currently working without a contract and remain concerned about the future of ISPRA, which is now headed by a former official with the Italian police, not a scientist. Those behind the rooftop protest offered this statement to <i>Science</i>Insider:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">
<p>We obtained some results but it is too little and much remains to be done. The institution is still running the risk of being dismantled. If the policy of the Minister doesn't take a consistent U-turn, it will ultimately lead to poor quality research and environmental monitoring, which will harm every citizen, not only researchers at Ispra.<br /></p></blockquote>

<p>The long and winding <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/01/science/politics-keeps-a-satellite-earthbound.html">story</a> of DSCOVR, the satellite proposed in 1998 by then-Vice President Al Gore and killed by the George W. Bush Administration, has taken a new turn. This week, President Barack Obama proposed launching the controversial satellite, which would send a craft a million miles away to sit between the sun and Earth.</p>
<p>The news that Obama wants to launch the craft was announced as part of the rollout of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) <a href="http://www.corporateservices.noaa.gov/%7Enbo/FY11_BlueBook/FY2011_Congressional_Budget.pdf">budget</a> 
(see p. 641), though it received scant attention at the time.</p>
<p>DSCOVR sits in storage at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center outside Washington, D.C. While the Bush Administration officially terminated plans to launch the satellite in 2006, congressional appropriators instructed the agency to spend $14 million in 2009 and 2010 refurbishing the satellite. </p>
<p>NOAA says it wants to use the satellite to monitor space weather from the sun, which can disrupt electronics on Earth. It puts the cost to prepare the satellite and its instruments at $9.5 million for this year and a total of $65 million once the satellite 
is launched.</p>
<p>Climate scientists would like to add sensors to the satellite, which can measure Earth’s radiation budget. NASA hasn't yet said whether it wants to invest money in adding those instruments, but plans don't preclude the Earth sensors. Supporters such as senators Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) will no doubt try to do exactly that. The NOAA budget also mentions the Air Force as taking responsibility for launch, which could be as soon as 2013. </p>
<p>“This is immensely positive news; things are coming to fruition,” says Francisco Valero of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California. He is the principal investigator for two Earth-sensing instruments that would presumably fly on 
DSCOVR if Congress approves Obama’s plans. "I have been fighting this thing since 1998," he says. </p>

BODY:
  <p>The world’s highest energy atom smasher, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), will run at half its maximum energy through 2011 and likely not at all in 2012. Officials at the European particle physics laboratory, CERN, had previously planned to run the gargantuan accelerator at 70% of maximum energy this year.</p>  <p>The change raises hopes at the LHC’s lower-energy rival, the Tevatron Collider at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois, of being extended through 2012 instead of being shut down next year. Fermilab researchers are hoping that their machine might collect enough data to beat the LHC to the discovery of the long-sought Higgs boson, a particle key to how physicists explain the origin of mass.</p>  <p>The $5.5 billion LHC is designed to blast protons into other protons at an energy of 14 trillion electron-volts (TeV), seven times the Tevatron’s maximum. But it cannot run at full energy because of a few faulty electrical connections, or “interconnects,” between the thousands of superconducting magnets that guide particles around the 27-kilometer subterranean ring. In September 2008, just 9 days after it first circulated particles, the LHC suffered a catastrophic breakdown when an interconnect between two magnets melted. That problem took 14 months to correct. The previous plan was to run the LHC briefly at 7 TeV, stop for a few months to rework the weakest interconnects, then ramp up 10 TeV later this year. CERN officials have now scaled back the energy to 7 TeV for this year and next, says Steve Myers, director of accelerators and technology at CERN.</p> 
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The new plan balances safety with the desire to collect data, Myers says. CERN officials say they will run at 7 TeV until experimenters collect enough data—1 inverse femtobarn, in the units they use—to give them a shot at, for example, discovering the new particle predicted by a theory called supersymmetry. The LHC would then shut down for a year so workers could replace all of the 10,000 interconnects with redesigned ones, allowing the LHC to run at 14 TeV in 2013. “By doing it this way, we have the time needed to design the new interconnects in a thorough way and make sure it’s done correctly,” says Myers.</p>  <p>CERN experimenters say the good news is that 1 inverse femtobarn of data set would let them search for supersymmetric particles and, even, the new dimensions of space predicted by some version of string theory. “Clearly we would have preferred to run at a higher energy,” says CERN Guido Tonelli, spokesperson for the 3800–member team working a particle detector called the Compact Muon Solenoid. But “this is a real physics run in which we will be able to tackle a large part of our research program.”</p>  <p>Meanwhile, their counterparts at Fermilab are reacting with caution. “It’s not like we’re rushing out and saying ‘We want to run [the Tevatron] in 2012!’ But we want to keep the possibility open,” says Fermilab’s Dmitri Denisov, co-spokesperson for the 510–member team working with Fermilab’s D0 particle detector. One extra year would only increase the size of the D0 data set slightly, from a projected 12 inverse femtobarns to about 15 inverse femtobarns, he notes. That increase alone might not be enough to justify the expense, Denisov says. It would be a different matter, he says, if Fermilab researchers were seeing hints of a Higgs boson that a little extra data might strengthen. A decision on running the Tevatron in 2012 won't have to be made for several months.</p>

  <p>For the last few years the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has been an also-ran among federal science programs. But if NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco gets her way with Congress, the agency will join the front ranks in 2011.</p><p> The agency was excluded from the America Competitiveness Initiative (a budget doubling for the physical sciences begun by the Bush Administration) and left with crumbs in the massive 2009 stimulus package. Observers wondered how a new Administration so supportive of environmental science and climate research could ignore an agency intended to be a good steward of the air and sea. (NOAA received a 9% budget increase last year, for example, but its satellite procurement efforts got the biggest share.) The second-rate status for ocean research was all the more ironic given that the president had put a world-renowned marine ecologist in the driver's seat.</p>  <p>But now Lubchenco has made her move, and the agency is poised for a huge investment in science. Yesterday's proposed 14% increase, to $5.5 billion, for the agency as a whole would be the largest increase in NOAA's budget in a decade. Research efforts at the agency get a 7% increase overall, to $522 million; big winners include earth-system modeling, research on marine pathogens, and studies related to ocean acidification. Each reflects priorities that go beyond the agency's bread-and-butter work of regulating fisheries and monitoring weather. Overall, climate work at the Department of Commerce, most of which is at NOAA, would rise by 21% under the new budget.</p>  <p>Lubchenco told reporters early last year that fixing a polar-orbiting, four-satellite observational system to provide military and civilian weather and climate data would be one of the biggest challenges of her time. That failed effort, the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System launched 15 years ago, involved the Air Force, NOAA, and NASA. But the program fell 5 years behind schedule and grew $7.5 billion over budget. The solution involves the Pentagon and NOAA essentially taking two satellites each, with NOAA requesting $600 million to pay for its larger role. </p>  <p>The remarkable thing for ocean scientists is that this boost to NOAA's satellite work has not cleaned out NOAA's "wet" work. Between 2005 and 2010 the agency's budget grew by roughly a quarter, but the budget of the atmospheric and oceanic sciences rose by only 8%. "That was the gorilla in the room," says Kevin Wheeler of advocacy organization the Consortium for Ocean Leadership in Washington, D.C. "But this time ocean science did pretty well." </p>

Its policy to ban Iranian-born students and scientists from certain master's degrees and from nuclear research facilities in the Netherlands is overly broad and a violation of an international civil rights treaty, the court ruled today.</p>  <p>"We're elated. This is a big victory, not just for us, but for science as well," says Behnam Taebi, a Ph.D. student in philosophy of technology at the Delft University of Technology and one of the plaintiffs in the case. Taebi has both Dutch and Iranian citizenship, as do the two other plaintiffs, nuclear physics professor Nasser Kalantar of the University of Groningen and chemistry student Kawe Bitaraf of Delft. (The court dismissed a fourth party in the case, the <a href="http://www.iraansestudenten.nl/#English">Action Group Iranian Students</a>.) </p>  <p>The Dutch ministries of science and foreign affairs enacted the new policy in 2008 as the implementation of U.N. Security Council <a href="http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Focus/IaeaIran/unsc_res1737-2006.pdf">resolution 1737</a>, adopted in 2006, which calls on member states to prevent training or teaching Iranian nationals in ways that would help Iran obtain nuclear technology. The Netherlands are particularly sensitive to the issue because Abdul Qadeer Khan, who helped build Pakistan's nuclear bomb, secretly collected valuable information while working at URENCO, a Dutch uranium-enrichment plant, in the 1970s.</p>

  <p> The Dutch policy bans Iranians from nine fields of study, including nuclear science and certain types of rocket technology, and from an experimental nuclear reactor at the Nuclear Research and Constultancy Group (NRG) in Petten (photo), URENCO, and three other facilities. </p>  <p>Iranian-born scientists say no other country has issued such a sweeping ban. The Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences has joined their cause, calling the policy "indefensible" and harmful to the reputation of Dutch science. "The Netherlands must remain a country that welcomes science and scientific researchers," KNAW President Robbert Dijkgraaf wrote science minister Ronald Plasterk—a renowned molecular biologist and KNAW member himself—in a <a href="http://www.knaw.nl/pdf/KNAW_letter_Iranian_students.pdf">letter</a> last year.</p>  <p>In its <a href="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/Verdict%20Iranian%20scientists.pdf">verdict</a>&nbsp;(Dutch)&nbsp;the court agreed that preventing Iran from obtaining certain types of technologies is legitimate, but said that there is "no objective and reasonable justification" for targeting all Iranians, and Iranians only. Doing so is a violation of article 26 of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>,&nbsp;a U.N. treaty that has been in force since 1976, the court says; to protect its nuclear secrets, the government should use other measures, such as individual screening.</p><p>A spokesperson for Plasterk said today that his ministry and the Dutch ministry of foreign affairs are still "studying" the verdict, and have yet to decide whether to appeal.</p>  <p>(Photo Credit: ECN)</p>

I can guess if there were students here in America from Iran studying these same things and America removed them, no UN treaty would budge us and our commitment to the world to hinder and stop terrorist behavior.

Interesting that the Dutch court had the courage to recognize the difference between a country's need to protect specific secrets and to be secure from threats from specific individuals vs. the broader rights of human beings to education otherwise available to all.  This is more than mere "political correctness," but about fundamental rights and freedoms that we here in the west, and the US in particular, supposedly champion.

The broad brush block on persons born in a particular country, in this case iran, was indeed an affront to rights enshrined in the ICCPR. If anything, that was the "political correctness."

Where is the common sense?  Using the UN for its source is folly--it is a failed organization which symbolizes ineptitude.  The decision by the court does not give  thoughtful reasoning; it provides them what they perceive as "wiggle room to avoid a decision".

This is a tough challenge in many regards. It is highly possible that the fact these students are studying both Nuclear and rocket science, one could rationally come to the conclusion that these "Students" are learning for ulterior motives. The Dutch in this case should have the rights to make a choice on who they teach, for the benefit for their programs, and the world. It is highly unclear what exactly Iran is planning to do with their Nuclear program, and it is highly suggestive that it would not be for energy production. 

I could understand the need to Nuclear studies if there wasn't students also taking Rocket Science as well. The link between the two is concern enough.

The problem is, the UN treaty is dissolving the Dutch from having their rights to remove suspected students. If they were to do this on a individual basis, there is still a chance of one or more to leak studies further down the line to the removed fellow class mates.

I think the Dutch are right, and should have the right to deal with their own system of education, without interference!

I can guess if there were students here in America from Iran studying these same things and America removed them, no UN treaty would budge us and our commitment to the world to hinder and stop terrorist behavior.

  <p>Did the IPCC 2007 <a href="http://www.ipcc-wg2.gov/AR4/website/13.pdf">report chapter</a> on Latin America "shame" itself by referencing a report written by "green activists"? The British conservative paper<i> The Times </i><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article7009705.ece">alleged</a> as much in a story over the weekend, calling "bogus" the following statement from the IPCC report:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Up to 40% of the Amazonian forests could react drastically to even a slight reduction in precipitation; this means that the tropical vegetation, hydrology and climate system in South America could change very rapidly to another steady state, not necessarily producing gradual changes between the current and the future situation (Rowell and Moore, 2000).</p> </blockquote>  <p>The newspaper's evidence was that the reference for the statement, "Rowell and Moore, 2000," is a non-peer-reviewed <a href="http://data.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll?AC=GET_RECORD&amp;XC=/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll&amp;BU=http://data.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/commande/index_newsite.htm&amp;TN=iucn&amp;SN=AUTO6529&amp;SE=923&amp;RN=7&amp;MR=20&amp;TR=0&amp;TX=1000&amp;ES=0&amp;CS=1&amp;XP=&amp;RF=WebRes&amp;EF=&amp;DF=WebAff&amp;RL=0&amp;EL=0&amp;DL=0&amp;NP=254&amp;ID=&amp;MF=&amp;MQ=&amp;TI=0&amp;DT=&amp;ST=0&amp;IR=2267&amp;NR=0&amp;NB=0&amp;SV=0&amp;BG=&amp;FG=&amp;QS=&amp;OEX=ISO-8859-1&amp;OEH=ISO-8859-1">report on forest fires</a> by the World Wildlife Fund, which cited as evidence for the claim a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v398/n6727/full/398505a0.html">1999 <i>Nature</i> paper</a>. Yet, <i>The </i><em>Times </em>says, the <i>Nature</i> paper lacks the 40% figure.</p>  <p>Now, Dan Nepstad, a forest expert, and colleagues at the Woods Hole Research Center who wrote the 1999 <em>Nature </em>paper say the IPCC statement is correct. He says it's a case of correct facts but footnotes that refer to the wrong papers or are at least incomplete. (Here's <a href="http://www.whrc.org/resources/online_publications/essays/2010-02-Nepstad_Amazon.htm">a statement</a> in which Nepstad lays out his position.)</p> 
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
  <p>As early as 1994, Nepstad and colleagues found that as much as half the Amazonian forest periodically fell to low enough moisture levels that trees died. In a 1998 experiment they learned that the threshold was roughly a 30% level of moisture in the soil. They confirmed in a 2004 paper—3 years before the IPCC report was published—that as much as half of the forest had soil with the 30% level. </p>  <p>So although IPCC failed to <em>cite </em>studies that would back up the "40%" claim in the WWF report or the IPCC chapter, scientists had found that as much as half of the forest was as sensitive as they describe. </p>  <p>In an e-mail Nepstad sent to <i>Times </i>reporter Jonathan Leake 2 days before the story ran, he detailed those finding, writing:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>At the time of the IPCC [report], there was ample evidence that a large portion of the Amazon forest is very close to the lower limit of rainfall that is necessary to sustain dense forest.&nbsp; We published an article in 1994 in <i>Nature </i>in which we estimated that approximately half of the forests of the Brazilian Amazon were periodically exposed to severe drought and soil moisture depletion, especially during El Nino events.&nbsp; </p> </blockquote>    <p>Today in Washington, D.C., speaking at an event hosted by the Center for American Progress, Christopher Field of the Carnegie Institution for Science dismissed the concern with the 40% figure as "inconsequential." Field will lead the portion of the 2014 IPCC report, so-called Working Group II, that will examine impacts such as forest drought. But he said that IPCC must "apply extra assessment" to reports in the "gray" literature, referring to non-peer-reviewed studies.</p><p>[Update 2/4 9am: The BBC ran a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8488395.stm">story</a> I hadn't seen in which a scientist reviewed other evidence of a very vulnerable rainforest on January 30]<br /></p><p><br /></p>

<p>Anticipating a series of federal recommendations on gene patents coming out tomorrow, a former Senator and four executives at biotech companies and biotech trade groups criticized the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for taking, they said, a stand that would undermine the the technology transfer objectives of the Bayh-Dole Act and the biotech industry generally in the United States.</p><p>Based on draft proposals, HHS's Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health and Society (SACGHS) is expected to issue six recommendations. The first is the most contentious, suggesting that Congress should enact laws to exempt gene patents from infringement liability—potentially allowing anyone to use any gene patent.</p><p>This worries biotech companies because, as James Davis, an executive vice president at Human Genome Sciences pointed out, gene patents typically cover far more than the A-C-G-T sequence of nucleic acids in a gene. The patents also cover proteins produced by the gene, antibodies for those proteins, and other downstream products of the gene. Without protection for all those pieces, companies have no incentive to invest in research, Davis argued, and he and others feared the recommendation would find sympathetic ears in Congress.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The other five recommendations—for instance, that companies be forced
to divulge more business secrets, or that the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office receive more technical advice—received less attention from the
executives, who were brought together by the Biotechnology Industry
Organization (BIO). But the executives did criticize the other five
points as onerous.</p><p>Although the SACGHS recommendations are
limited to gene patents, much of the biotech criticism accused the
proposals of striking at the heart of the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act, which
helped universities commercialize discoveries and move them into the
marketplace. Before Bayh-Dole, potentially useful products often
languished. Former Senator Birch Bayh, who co-authored the act, joined
the executives in their criticism today, calling the SACGHS
recommendations an attempt "to reimpose the failed policies of the
past, policies that just didn't work."</p><p>Jon Soderstrom, the head
technology licensing official at Yale University, echoed that comment, saying,
"What frightens me is that [the recommendations] reconstitute the world
as it existed before 1980."</p><p>Coincidentally, the HHS
recommendations are appearing at the same time that a federal court in
New York is hearing an important case, ACLU v. Myriad, on whether gene
patents violate the Constitution. Myriad owns the patents on two key
breast cancer genes.</p>

<p>The last major science holdover in the Obama Administration is stepping down this spring, leaving the president free to appoint a new director for the $7-billion National Science Foundation.</p><p>Arden Bement announced today that he will be leaving NSF on 1 June to lead a new public policy institute at Purdue University. A nuclear engineer, he's been on leave from Purdue since coming to Washington in 2001 to head the National Institutes of Standards and Technology. In 2004 President George W. Bush named him acting NSF director following the resignation of Rita Colwell and, several months later, to a full, 6-year term.</p><p>His performance since then at NSF gave the incoming Democratic Administration little reason to replace him. But his decision to step down 6 months before his term expires will ignite speculation about the next head of an agency that has traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The Obama Administration has pledged to continue a 2006 promise by Bush
to double NSF's budget, although it extended the term from 7 to 10
years. This week Obama requested $7.4 billion for NSF, an 8% boost that
stands out in a <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/02/science-triumph.html">budget</a> that seeks a freeze on overall domestic
discretionary spending.
</p><p>NSF doesn't conduct any research itself, but its system of
supporting academic science across almost every discipline is widely
admired. Many countries have created agencies meant to imitate its
approach, most recently the European Science Foundation. China's
booming investment in basic research over
the past 2 decades has been propelled by its own version of the U.S.
National Science Foundation, which this year celebrates its 60th
aniversary.</p><p>At an age when most people are already retired,
Bement says, "I feel like 77 going on 45." His return to West Lafayette,
Indiana, will certainly be a homecoming for him. The Global Policy
Research Institute that he will lead is part of a strategic plan
hatched by Purdue's president, France Córdova, who is a member of the
National Science Board, NSF's oversight body. And Richard Buckius,
Purdue's vice president for research, served as head of NSF's
engineering directorate before going to Purdue in 2008.</p><p>The new
institute will draw on existing faculty and plans to offer a
certificate for undergraduates and, eventually, a master's degree as
well. Buckius, a member of the task force that designed the institute,
says Bement is exactly what the university was looking for. "There are
a lot of public policy programs, but our strength is taking an
engineering, data-driven approach to a range of issues that are global
in nature. And that's what Arden has been doing at NSF."</p><p>Bement's
immediate successor will likely be Cora Marrett, who for the past year
has served as acting deputy NSF director. So her current post may also
need to be filled by the Obama Administration.</p>

<p>Yale University plans to shrink its incoming class of graduate students by up to 15% as part of an effort to save $50 million in the upcoming academic year. The cost-cutting is a response to a $150-million deficit created by a 29% plunge in its endowment during the recession. Additional steps, announced yesterday by President Richard Levin in a <a href="http://www.yale.edu/provost/html/provost_ltr_budget.html">letter</a> to faculty and staff members, include freezing some faculty salaries, "consolidating" services like human resources and information technology, and adjusting thermostats to 68°F in the winter and 75°F in the summer.</p><p>Levin said that Yale will boost stipend support by 2% for students in their first few semesters. Research grants pick up the tab after that, explains Steve Girvin, deputy provost for science and technology at Yale and a professor of physics and applied physics.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<br />A Yale graduate department typically enrolls 20 to 30 new students
a year. Two or three fewer graduate students per department will mean
fewer research assistants from which professors can choose down the
line, Girvin says. "It's not the direction that we want to go, but it's
necessary in the current financial climate," Girvin says. Witold Skiba,
an associate professor of physics and the director of graduate studies
for the physics department, worries that "if [the cut] persists for
several years, it might start affecting research."<br />

<p>Although his request for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) represents only $300 million in a departmental budget of $28.4 billion, Energy Secretary Steven Chu clearly believes that the fledgling agency is his scientific ace in the hole. The proposed funding for ARPA-E was unveiled this week as part of the president's 2011 budget request for the Department of Energy (DOE). It would be the agency's first regular appropriation (although it received $400 million last year in the massive federal stimulus package). And the fact that the request is $75 million larger than the increase Chu is seeking for DOE's $5 billion Office of Science speaks volumes about his confidence in an agency that he championed in an influential 2005 National Academies report on strengthening U.S. science.</p>
<p>Speaking with reporters today after testifying on the DOE budget before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee of the U.S. Senate, Chu said he's convinced that an agency whose director has been on board for only a few months and whose staff could fit around a dining room table will accomplish great things. Here's what he had to say in response to a question from <em>Science</em>Insider:</p>

-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<blockquote><p>Now, the Office of Science is an extremely well run
organization, but it's $5 billion. And there is a level of conservatism
there. Not only that, the Office of Science does mission-oriented
research.</p>
<p>ARPA-E is a very different story. This is a quick hit of 2 or 3
years of money. After that, you need to find money either in the Office
of Science or the applied areas, or in the private sector. So it's a
very different philosophy than in the Office of Science, which has
ongoing projects and has sustainability and other issues.</p>
<p>So, is $300 million the right amount? Absolutely. In fact, I
wouldn't mind having a little more. If you look at the team, from the
director on down, they are an extraordinary group of individuals. …</p>
<p>… When we did the <em>Rising Above the Gathering Storm</em> report,
the committee told me to sell the idea of ARPA-E to Congress. So I did,
and during one of the hearings, they tried to get me to say that the
idea was controversial, and that some people liked it and other people
didn't. In fact, all the people said, "If it's well-managed, it's a
good idea." DARPA was well-managed, and it's done great things. … And I
can say with absolute confidence that we've got an extraordinary team
of people. So that this will be money well-spent.</p> </blockquote>

BODY:
  <p>Is National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins planning to steer his ocean liner of an institute toward "big biology" at the expense of single-investigator grants? That was the fear of some in the biomedical science community on Monday when Collins discussed President Obama's budget request for a 3.2% raise, to $32 billion, for NIH in 2011. But other NIH watchers say that a close look at the budget proposal suggests that Collins's words are just spin. </p><p>Since his&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/08/collins-sets-fi.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">first day</a>&nbsp;on the job last August, Collins has repeatedly emphasized his&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/sci;327/5961/36" style="text-decoration: underline;">five "themes"</a>&nbsp;for NIH: high-throughput technologies, translational science, health care reform, global health, and reinvigorating biomedical research. This week, Collins put his money where his mouth is. The portfolio of each NIH institute has been "mapped against the five themes," he said, with bigger increases for the priority areas.</p> 
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
  <p>Collins also said that because the research he's emphasizing tends to be funded with contracts and centers, NIH came up short of money to maintain its investigator-initiated grants—bread-and-butter R01s and other types of grants—known collectively as research project grants (RPGs). In 2011, NIH expects to fund 199 fewer of these grants, which are the mainstay of basic research labs. The same reasoning appears in the Department of Health and Human Service's <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/asrt/ob/docbudget/2011budgetinbrief.pdf">summary budget document</a> (see p. 40):</p>  <blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="border: medium none ; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 40px; padding: 0px;"><p>Many of the opportunities that will advance the NIH Director's scientific themes may best be accomplished through other research mechanisms, such as research and development contracts for comparative effectiveness studies, or research centers for genomic and other high-throughput technologies. Consequently, NIH estimates that it will support 9,052 new and competing RPGs in FY 2011, a decrease of 199 below the estimated level for FY 2010, excluding Recovery Act funds. The total number of RPGs to be funded in FY 2011 is expected to be 37,001, an increase of 195 above FY 2010 non-Recovery Act levels.</p></blockquote>  <p>That seems to confirm worries among some scientists that Collins, who led the Human Genome Project, would favor big projects over bench science. Scientists "live and die by R01s," says a biomedical policy analyst who didn't want to be quoted by name. "We originally thought the five themes were a stump speech. Now it looks like it's policy." </p>  <p>But is NIH really cutting back on RPGs? According to Howard Garrison, budget guru at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, the slight drop in new grants has little to do with a shift in priorities. Most of it can be blamed on a 2% hike in grant size—good news for grantees squeezed by inflation in the past few years. The remainder likely results from the vagaries of the turnover of grants: Awards can be from 3 to 5 years in length, so the number that expire and free up money for new grants fluctuates each year. Overall, the number of RPGs is rising, and the amount of money for them—$17.1 billion in 2011—is going up 3.2%, in step with NIH's overall budget.</p>  <p>So why the rhetoric from Collins? "A lot of this is packaging," says Garrison. Collins probably wants to send a message to Congress that he's shaking things up at NIH. And in any case, the president's budget proposal doesn't mean much because Congress usually ends up giving NIH more than the president requests. </p>

If you thought Zerhouni hijacked scarce total resources under the "translational science" buzzword into unaccountable wasteful big science busywork activity, then watch out for Collins.  Collins is to Obama what Zerhouni was to Bush.  Identical narrowminded agenda's bent on wasting rare resources needed for basic groundbreaking conceptual research using different language to justify throwing it away at big project, inefficient database generation activities.

Zerhouni's pet agenda was wasting resources on empirical correlative activity with incremental advances like touting extension of life of a patient by a week or two.  To overcome limitations, we just need to empirically design and test more and more drugs.  Collins is bent on the genomic religious agenda that sequencing everything forever down to every organism, individual and cell at any moment will reveal something.  To overcome limitations, we just need to get more and more sequence ad infinitum.

Federal funding is only needed for small investigator run conceptual and fundamental non-goal oriented projects of no more than a staff of 5 under any one group leader and funding under 300K annual (R01s).  

If big science is needed and justified, then R01 investigators can decide on that and pool their resources.  Any other type ventures and larger goal oriented projects should be funded by private enterprise with at best government loan seed money.  This insures continuation of productive projects and sunsetting of wasteful non-productive ones.

The first such assessment will be released in November this year. We seek international collaboration to make this network effective. … It is becoming clear that the roots of the problem we face today are in the current patterns of global production and consumption, which are not sustainable.

<p>In what may presage an intellectual property battle, Rudolf Jaenisch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and Konrad Hochedlinger of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston will be awarded a patent on a technique for turning adult mammalian cells into stem cells that can in principle become any kind of cell in the body. The approach—reprogramming somatic cells—promises to be a boon for regenerative medicine. But other groups have similar patent claims pending, and some researchers worry that a tangle of patents could delay medical applications.</p>
<p>The pending award of the patent was announced on 4 February by Fate Therapeutics, a San Diego-based company that Jaenisch and others founded in 2007. The November 2003 application describes a possible approach to somatic cell reprogramming. "With its early priority dates and territory reach, the Jaenisch portfolio is formidable," Paul Grayson, president of Fate Therapeutics, said in a press release. Fate "is counting on this patent to raise funding, so they will be relentless" in pushing their claims, says stem cell researcher Jeanne Loring of the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego. "It's the nature of the biotech business."</p>

-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>But the patent application contains no experimental results. In 2006, Kyoto University’s Shinya Yamanaka reported for the first time creating what he called induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by triggering mouse skin cells to revert to an undifferentiated state of pluripotency. In 2007, Yamanaka and James Thomson of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, simultaneously duplicated the feat using human cells. In response to a query from <em>Science</em>, Kyoto University's Center for iPS
Cell Research and Application, which Yamanaka directs, issued a statement that reads in part: "Our university filed the world's first patent application associated with iPS [cell] technology and is now trying to acquire patent rights in many countries, including the U.S. We believe that the Fate Therapeutics patent will not affect our patent
applications.'' </p>
<p>In an e-mail to <em>Science</em>, Fate Therapeutics spokesperson Jessica Yingling wrote that the company was not yet disclosing conditions for possible
licensing of its patent. "But we want to reinforce that we do not want to impede progress but work with all involved to spur innovation and the translation of iPS cell technology to new tools for the industry and therapies for patients in need." </p>
<p>Since Yamanaka's breakthrough, dozens of groups have reported other ways of reprogramming cells as well as techniques to control differentiation of stem cells into neurons, cardiovascular cells, and other tissues of interest for regenerative medicine. The U.S. patent office's database has more than 200 applications that mention somatic cell reprogramming. "I expect cross-licensing and, hopefully, some of the patent owners will insist as part of their agreements that the patents be widely, inexpensively, and nonexclusively licensed," says Loring. </p>

BODY:

<p>German researchers are <a href="http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/news/468.docu.html">moving their field tests of genetically modified peas to North Dakota</a>. University of Hannover plant geneticist Hans-Jörg Jacobsen&nbsp;says that Germany's&nbsp;unclear regulations&nbsp;regarding field trials of GM plants and the continuing threat of vandalism prompted the move.</p>
<p>And when asked about the application of the socalled precautionary principle to GM plants, Jacobsen offered this rather political response (<em>see * Correction below</em>): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The precautionary principle as such is questionable. If I were to agree with the precautionary principle as a central concept, I would also have to accept George W. Bush's war against Iraq, which in my view is unjustified. I am no more able to do this than to consider this principle important in the case of GM plants. Even Bush, that total loser, needed no evidence of weapons of mass destruction before launching an attack; mere suspicion was enough for him, as it is for many ideologists in this country. English makes a distinction between the "precautionary principle" and the "precautionary approach". German sticklers for principles probably can’t make this distinction. Perhaps that explains why there is no neat translation of the term "precautionary approach" in German.</p></blockquote>
<p>* <em>The above quote was taken from an </em><a href="http://www.gmo-safety.eu/en/archive/2004/270.docu.html"><em>interview posted several years ago </em></a><em>and due to an editing error mistakenly used in a way that made it seem a response to recent events.<br /></em></p>

What everyone seems to keep forgetting is the fact that independent safety studies have shown many GM crops to produce adverse reactions in those eating the crops and the environment. Therefore it is logical that independent well-designed laboratory safety studies must be completed before field trials are even considered.  

The experience with GM corn has clearly shown that unleashing GMOs into the environment results in contamination of the soil and other plants. 

"Give Peas a chance" is an industry biased headline. Has this publication been corrupted by the agro-chem industry?

Why do we allow the madness to continue?

<p>Officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as long as 4 years ago, hoped that NOAA would be the home of what they were calling Climate Services. Today, with the launch of a new Web site called <a href="http://www.climate.gov/">climate.gov</a>, NOAA's Climate Services has debuted, albeit modestly.</p>
<p>Congressional fans of the idea have proposed that Climate Services grow to be a $300 million clearinghouse for climate prediction tools, adaptation services, and analytical data streams to equal the National Weather Service—with an equally diverse set of customers in business and government who want to know what the changing climate will mean for them.</p>
<p>For now the Obama Administration has aimed low, with a flashy but easy-to-use Web site that brings together some of NOAA's climate information but <a href="http://www.climate.gov/about.html">acknowledges</a> that there is much government climate data yet to be synthesized and made easy to understand. And its proposed funding for this year is also modest: $1.5 million, for the Web site.</p>

<p>For years, Asian carp have been slowly moving up the Mississippi River. In addition to competing with native fish, they jump out of the water when startled—sometimes even posing a hazard to boaters.</p>
<p>Now, with the invasive fish nearing Chicago, the Obama Administration has announced a new <a href="http://www.asiancarp.org/">strategy</a> for preventing the carp from entering the Great Lakes, where they could threaten a sportfishing industry worth $7 billion. The plan also includes money for research on how to battle the fish. However, the move appears unlikely to end a feud between midwestern states over what to do about the carp. </p>

-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The state of Michigan is worried about the impact of Asian carp on sportfishing in Lake Michigan and other lakes. The state's Attorney General sued Illinois to force the state to close a canal that connects the Mississippi River to the Great Lakes. But Illinois refused, arguing that such a move would harm industries that rely on shipping through the canal. Last month, the Supreme Court declined to resolve the dispute. </p>
<p>In a press conference this afternoon, officials from the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that $78.5 million would be spent to fight the carp, coming from EPA's $475 million Great Lake restoration initiative. "It does represent a major investment," said Cameron Davis, an EPA senior adviser on Great Lakes issues. </p>
<p>Asian carp DNA has already been detected in Lake Michigan, suggesting that some fish already arrived—but perhaps not enough to establish a breeding population. Among the steps to be taken are construction of a third $10.5 million <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/301/5630/157">electric barrier</a> in the canal to block more carp from arriving. The funding would also allow the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to expand its monitoring in the canal and accelerate DNA testing. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will speed up their study of the feasibility of permanently closing the locks. And $1.5 million will be spent on research into possible controls of Asian carp, such as targeted poisons and ways to disrupt their spawning. "We can and will stop the Asian carp," said Nancy Sutley, chair of CEQ. </p>
<p>The announcement didn't go over well with Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox. In a statement he described the plan as "full of half-measures and gimmicks when keeping Asian carp from devastating the Great Lakes $7 billion fishery requires only one step: immediately closing the locks." </p>

<p>First Lady Michelle Obama has launched a major initiative on
childhood obesity, one of her signature topics. The carefully orchestrated
rollout—Obama has been foreshadowing her plan for over a month now, speaking at
a mayors' conference, a local YMCA, and elsewhere—includes a new nonprofit
foundation and a range of approaches to tackle the problem. </p>

<p>The goal of what she’s calling <a href="http://letsmove.gov/">Let’s
Move</a>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“Solve the epidemic of
childhood obesity within a generation.” It’s a tall order for a problem that’s grown
dramatically. More than 12% of 2 to 5 year olds are obese, compared with 5%
around 1980; for 6 to 11 year olds, the number has increased from just over 6%,
to 17%. </p>

<p>Obama’s strategy seeks to expand on many approaches that have been tried before, often on a state or local level.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>These include teaching doctors to monitor their young patients’ body mass index; boosting standards for food served in schools; encouraging kids to exercise more often (the recommended amount is 60 minutes a day); and making healthy food more accessible. Some of these methods are backed by additional funds, such as $400 million in the President’s 2011 budget, unveiled last week, to bring grocery stores and farmer’s markets to areas that don’t have them now.</p><p>While a number of studies have found that tackling just one cause of obesity—insufficient exercise, for example—often doesn’t help much, there’s some evidence that multi-pronged approaches can be more successful.One example is a pilot program targeting childhood obesity in African American children in Mississippi with eating and exercise.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Randomized trials of different behavioral weight loss strategies are underway, including one studying preschoolers in Australia.</p><p>An intriguing element of Obama’s plan is the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ahealthieramerica.org/" style="text-decoration: underline;">Partnership For A Healthier America</a>, a foundation announced today that’s supported by some big names in childhood obesity work, including the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The foundation’s goals, posted on its Web site, are still vague: It aims to develop a membership network of groups, including businesses, academic institutions, and local governments who will act on Obama’s obesity plan.</p>

Wow its great to see the first lady making a difference! We have started using SweetLeaf Stevia Sweetener as a sugar substitute in our home because it has 0 calories, 0 carbs, 0 chemicals, 0 glycemic index. Not only does it taste great, but no chemicals are added so there is no aftertaste. I've been able to find it in most grocery stores too which is very convenient. 

Congratulations to Michelle Obama for this great national campaign!

<p>Every climate scientist in the world&nbsp;must be&nbsp;begging their information technology experts for the latest antivirus, spam, and firewall software. In the latest e-mail fracas,&nbsp;Nicholas Stern,&nbsp;who in 2006&nbsp;led an <a href="http://www.occ.gov.uk/activities/stern.htm">influential&nbsp;review on the economics of climate change</a>, apparently had his <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/science_technology/climate+economistaposs+email+security+breach/3532642">e-mail account hijacked into sending&nbsp;fake e-mails</a>, along with a virus, to colleagues at&nbsp;the London School of Economic's <a href="http://www2.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/Home.aspx">Grantham Institute for Climate Change</a>, which Stern heads.</p>
<p>Yet there's no evidence so far that this was a deliberate attempt to read or copy e-mails from researchers, as happened recently to climate scientists at University of East Anglia. Bob Ward, policy and communications director at Grantham Institute, says this type of e-mail "spoofing" happens regularly at all universities. "It's nothing like the UEA incident," he says.</p>
<p>Ward also released this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can confirm that an e-mail spoofing incident occurred on 27 January 2010. This was a 'spoofing' e-mail attack from an unknown sender using the e-mail address of Nicholas Stern, who is IG Patel Professor of Economics and Government and Chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. The attacker did not gain access to any e-mail messages. The attack was identified very quickly by members of the School's IT security team who took steps to prevent it from causing any damage. Information about this attack was passed on to the Police Central eCrime Unit.</p></blockquote>

At least the WG2, which tends to be less scrutinized, may need a refinement of standards. Although the rules seem to allow the use of "gray" literature, the material should be based on a verifiable scientific source. That said, I think this issue has been blown out of proportion by some, and it's not really surprising that an occasional error is discovered, given the volumes of material and number of authors involved.

As for the original Science article, it is interesting how it's been presented, and not really surprising that Tol et al. have joined the recent fuss over the IPCC:

Climate Chief Pachauri has ruined his reputation in the scientific community and the public-at-large by pushing the faulty Himalayan-glacier estimates. If the IPCC is to restore its reputation and become an effective advocate for climate change legislation, they need a new leader and more transparent research reporting mechanisms.  Himalayagate cannot happen again.

<p>by Greg Miller and Constance Holden</p>
<p>Today the American Psychiatric Association (APA) releases <a href="http://www.dsm5.org/">proposed revisions</a> to the most influential book in psychiatry: the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> (<i>DSM</i>). These draft criteria for diagnosing mental disorders are the result of a decade of labor by scores of researchers and clinicians. After gathering comments on the draft criteria and conducting field trials to test them, APA plans to publish a new, fifth edition of the <i>DSM </i>in 2013.</p>
<p>By classifying mental disorders and giving them names, <i>DSM </i>not only influences how doctors diagnose and treat their patients. It also sways how insurance companies decide which conditions to cover, how pharmaceutical companies design clinical trials, and how funding agencies decide what research to fund. Making changes to such a widely used document was bound to be controversial, and it has been. "It's sort of like repairing an airplane while it's still flying," says psychiatrist Steven Hyman, provost of Harvard University and a member of the committee leading <i>DSM-V</i> revisions.</p>
<p>The researchers and clinicians working on <i>DSM-V</i> had several ambitious goals, including using new findings from neuroscience and genetics to shape diagnoses, minimizing vast diagnostic dead zones of abnormal behavior that fall in the cracks of current criteria, and introducing the idea of "dimensions" to reflect varying degrees of symptom severity and the overlap among disorders.</p>
<p>Some critics, including the two psychiatrists who led the previous two major revisions to <i>DSM</i>, have argued that such an ambitious overhaul should not have been attempted until more is known about the biological underpinnings of mental illness.</p>

EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Duke University psychiatrist Allen Frances, who led the<i> DSM-IV</i> revisions, penned a widely read and debated editorial last year warning that drastic changes to the criteria for diagnosing mental disorders could have unintended consequences, including "false 'epidemics' " of mental illness.</p><p>Within the work groups focusing on different types of disorders, members have faced scientific dilemmas and—in some cases—pressure from patient groups. Among a number of new proposals that seem likely to cause a stir are a diagnosis of "pre-psychotic risk syndrome" applicable to young people and a redefinition of autism spectrum disorders that would eliminate Asperger's syndrome, which many consider to be a mild form of autism.</p><p><p class="MsoNormal">See tomorrow's issue of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Science</i>
for a more comprehensive overview of the DSM-V draft criteria. In the coming
weeks <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Science</i> will explore several of
the new proposals--and researchers' and clinicians' reaction to them--in more
detail.&nbsp;</p></p><p><br /></p>
