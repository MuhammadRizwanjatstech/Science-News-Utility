Field says that the 2007 IPCC report "<a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/newsblog/2009/02/climate-change-worst-case-scen.html">underemphasized</a>" the growing challenge posed by changes in the terrestrial and ocean carbon cycle. Ocean and soils take up about 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year—for perspective, deforestation and energy-related emissions add 10 billion—but they may be losing that ability as the globe warms. They may even start leaking their own carbon. The science is rife with uncertainties, but since the 2007 report, a number of findings have solidified—and the news is wholly bad. The carbon cycle studies on which IPCC authors based their report didn't emphasize the vulnerabilities of the carbon stored in natural sinks, says Field, but those potential sources are "really important." </p>

The White House announced today that it was nominating Kristina Johnson, currently provost of Johns Hopkins University, to be undersecretary of energy. If confirmed, she'll move into an office down the hall from Energy Secretary Steven Chu, former director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and oversee a wide swath of DOE's activities, including development of energy from coal, wind, solar, and nuclear sources, and the management of radioactive waste. The position is distinct from undersecretary for science, which oversees DOE's $4.8 billion Office of Science. </p>

When you do something as big as the recovery package, there's tremendous pressure to make sure that money's not wasted, that you don't just push the money out the door without any attention to assessment and evaluation to make sure it's well spent. But the other side of the coin is that you don't want to burden people who are doing good work with a degree of reporting requirements that impair their productivity in any significant way. So it's a fundamental tension, and I'm not sure that we've got it exactly right. But it's something we'll be looking at with [the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB)].</p>

Today, the Union of Concerned Scientists broke ranks and asserted that <a href="http://ucsusa.org/food_and_agriculture/science_and_impacts/science/failure-to-yield.html">genetic engineering is simply ineffective</a>, at least in increasing crop yields. </p>  <p>UCS's Doug Gurian-Sherman searched the scientific literature for side-by-side comparisons of conventional and genetically engineered lines of corn and soybeans. He found that in almost all cases, genetically engineered crops did not produce larger harvests. The one exception was insect-resistant Bt corn, which produced higher yields only when neighboring plots of conventional corn suffered infestations of a worm called the European corn borer. Crop yields have increased significantly over the past decade, he says, but almost all of that increase was due to traditional plant breeding or other agricultural practices.</p>

The move by the Obama Administration comes after long resistance on the issue by the Bush EPA.The Center for Biological Diversity threatened to sue EPA last year before the agency relented, agreeing to review the criteria for regulating the acidity of natural water bodies. <br /></p><p>Under current rules, EPA designates ocean or freshwater areas as "impaired waters" under the Clean Water Act if the pH of the water is 0.2 units off naturally occurring levels. Scientists want EPA to review these rules for a number of reasons. There's <a href="http://www.mcbi.org/publications/pub_pdfs/feely_etal_2008_pices.pdf">evidence</a> that marine ecosystems may be affected by change in pH of less than 0.2 units. In addition, a simple numerical limit may not be an adequate safeguard. Perhaps a better standard, says CBD's Miyoko Sakashita, would be one in which environmental factors, such as the biological health of a particular species in a marine ecosystem, would be used by regulators to set appropriate limits. Plus, there's new science coming out on the problem all the time.</p>  <p>"It's going to be tricky to set regulations for," says geochemist Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Palo Alto, California. Different organisms in the same ecosystem often have different levels of tolerance for acidic water, he points out; one reef's threshold may be different than another's. </p>

<p>For an eclectic and even rollicking tour of thoughts about the swine flu outbreak, see Stephen Colbert's <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/226864/may-06-2009/laurie-garrett">interview with Laurie Garrett</a> on <i>The Colbert Report. </i>“When you heard that there was a swine flu going around, did you think ca-ching?” Colbert asks Garrett, a Pulitzer Prize–<img class="mt-image-right" alt="Newsweek" src="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/090501_OVCover-thumb4.jpg" width="90" height="119" />winning reporter who formerly worked at <i>Newsday</i> and NPR, and wrote the best-selling book <i>The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance</i><span id="btAsinTitle" style=""> </span>and the 18 May cover story for Newsweek&nbsp; <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/195692">“Fear &amp; the Flu</a>.” Colbert then asked Garrett if she thought H5N1, the cause of avian flu, was five times as bad as the H1N1 strain driving this swine flu outbreak. Also read Garrett’s <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/19369/">5 May “update”</a> at the Council on Foreign Relations, where she now works. Here’s how Garrett opens her provocative update: “It is hard to believe that only days have passed since the world grew fixated on [the] spread of influenza in Mexico. Harder, still, is coming to grips with the notion that it's all over, no dangerous pandemic is imminent.”

<p>Both Spirit and its sister machine—Opportunity, on the other side of the planet—have encountered some tough roving before, but this time Spirit seems to be in a real pickle. The soft soil entrapping Spirit “is very insidious stuff,” says Mars rover principal investigator Steven Squyres of Cornell University. “You cannot detect it without stumbling into it.”</p>  <p><a href="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/Spiritrover.jpg"><img title="Spirit rover" style="border-width: 0px; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px; display: inline;" alt="Spirit rover" src="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/Spiritrover_thumb.jpg" width="180" align="left" border="0" height="180" /></a> Getting Spirit out is going to be “tough with a 5-wheel rover,” says Squyres. Spirit has been dragging one dead wheel in the dirt for 3 years now, but it’s worse than that, according to rover project manager John Callas of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Spirit’s wheels are practically buried in the soft soil (see the two tracks in this image), its left-middle wheel has stalled, and “the rover’s belly may be sitting on a small mound of rocks.” That would tend to take the rover’s weight off the wheels, which need the weight to get traction. “Spirit is in a very difficult situation,” Callas concludes.</p>  <p>Spirit may yet escape, but its predicament raises the specter of shutting down a still-capable vehicle. “We really have not developed a ‘do not resuscitate’ list” of circumstances mandating ending a mission, says Mars exploration lead scientist Michael Meyer of NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C. If Spirit cannot be moved, for example, all concerned would review the spacecraft's health, the science that could be done from an immobilized rover, and the cost of that science. Currently, the two rovers cost $20 million per year to operate. Would images of winter setting in on Mars 6 months from now be worth $27,000 a day? NASA may have to decide.</p>    <p>Photo: NASA</p>

Today, Cox heads CDC’s influenza division, which has put her at the vortex of the response to the current H1N1 swine flu outbreak. She is also helping to draw up research plans to better understand how this particular swine flu virus has managed to transmit so well in humans and what it does to the human body.</p>  <p>Cox has been at the storm’s center in more ways than one: On 23 April, the day she learned that the unique H1N1 first found in the United States and identified by CDC was also spreading in Mexico, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/02/AR2009050202353.html?hpid=topnews">lightning struck her house</a> and all but burned it to the ground. Still, on Mother's Day, 10 May, Cox spoke with <i>Science</i>Insider at length about the studies under way at CDC. She explained how scientists there are probing autopsy tissue, immune systems of people who received the swine flu vaccine in 1976, older cases of swine influenza infecting humans, and how currently infected people handle the infection. CDC researchers are also trying to develop improved diagnostics for this influenza A (H1N1) and to assess the potential value of seasonal vaccination against this strain more carefully, as well as the virus's ability to dodge antiviral drugs. Cox says the propensity of a given influenza virus to combine with its relatives and create a new strain altogether—this one is a “triple reassortant” of human, pig, and bird—may have a silver lining, as it could pick up genes from a relative that our immune systems have met and know how to defeat.</p>  <p>This is a condensed transcript of the interview, edited for clarity.</p>        <p><b>Q: What are the top priority research questions for you and your group?<br />N.C.: </b>We’ll be looking at animal models and also autopsy tissue from deceased patients who’ve had this disease to look at the pathogenesis.</p>

Many leading influenza researchers immediately dismissed the theory out of hand or flat-out refused to speak about it. “Oh, come on, forget about this,” said virologist Peter Palese of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. But influenza scientists at the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)—who similarly have deep skepticism about the thesis—have been forced to examine the evidence and publicly discuss what to many is a far-fetched idea. <br /></p><p>Adrian Gibbs, who worked at the Australian National University in

There his focus was on how to develop compounds in a way to make sure they would not be carcinogenic. After leaving EPA in 1999, he spent 5 years at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. He joined Yale in 2007. </p>   <p><a href="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/Anastas_Paul.jpg"><img title="Anastas_Paul" style="border: 0px none ; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px; display: inline;" alt="Anastas_Paul" src="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/Anastas_Paul_thumb.jpg" width="175" align="left" border="0" height="244" /></a></p>    <p>In 1991, Anastas coined the term "green chemistry." It means different things to different people; check out the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/297/5582/807">12 principles</a> in a 2002 article Anastas cowrote for <em>Science</em>. Generally, green chemistry refers to sustainability and the concept of designing and producing chemicals in a way that minimizes the potential for health or environmental hazards. (At EPA, the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/gcc/">green chemistry program</a> is in OPPT.) </p>  <p>So what might the nomination mean for EPA, if Anastas is confirmed by the Senate? Henry, who directed the American Chemistry Council's research portfolio, says that an injection of green chemistry could stimulate more innovation at ORD. </p>  <p>Anastas appears to be thinking along those lines. He wrote about the need for a new approach in an <a href="http://www.nyas.org/snc/uu/spring_09/09_Magazine_Spring_Memoir.pdf">article</a> in <i>The New York Academy of Sciences Magazine</i> this spring: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Many of our attempts at environmental regulation have been mandates for technological bandages that didn’t always foster innovation. Though some accomplished the desired goals, the approaches were often costly and inefficent. The next generation of actions taken by government in concert with NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] and industry needs to be far more about innovation and thoughtful design. </p> </blockquote>    <p>Credit: Michael Marsland/Yale University</p>

But Donald Olson, a New York City–based epidemiologist who runs the influenza monitoring project at the <a href="https://isds.cirg.washington.edu/distribute/index.php" target="_blank">International Society for Disease Surveillance (ISDS)</a>, disagrees. “If New York City, Boston, and Seattle are indicators of what’s to come for the rest of the country, then we ain’t seen nothing yet,” says Olson.  <p>CDC based its optimistic assessment on “influenza-like illness” (ILI) reported at outpatient clinics in its surveillance network and found a drop in seven of the country’s nine regions (the two exceptions include New York City and Boston). But ISDS collects its own data from a dozen sites around the country, and, as Olson explains, is able to “drill down” and analyze more subtle measurements like fever and severe pneumonia. Their analysis, he says, indicates that the first few weeks of the swine flu outbreak led many people who had respiratory illness and diarrhea—the “worried ill”—to seek medical care. “In normal times, these people would have stayed home sick,” says Olson.</p>  <p>As fear of swine flu has subsided, Olson suspects that fewer of these people have gone to the doctor, leading to drops in reports of ILI that are <i>not</i> accurate indicators of drops in the spread of the novel H1N1 virus that causes swine flu.</p>  <p>Although CDC had  also noted increases in Boston and New York City, Olson says his more carefully parsed data show “massive increases” that look “mild” in the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/regions2008-2009/hhssenusmap.htm" target="_blank">CDC regional data</a>. CDC also shows ILI in Seattle dropping down at week 20, which is the opposite of what ISDS finds. Unfortunately, says Olson, no one has systematically collected data about the actual presence of the new H1N1 virus, as it would overtax testing labs. “We’re dealing with so much uncertainty, and we have imperfect measures,” says Olson. “But we need to know what they’re weaknesses are.”</p>

That tops the 16,000 applications NIH normally receives in each of its regular three grant cycles per year. The NIH Center for Scientific Review (CSR) has recruited 18,000 scientists to review Challenge proposals this summer and 2000 for other stimulus grants, in addition to the 8000 reviewers it will use for regular grants. NIH tried to put a positive spin on the numbers in a <a href="http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jun2009/od-08.htm" target="_blank">press release</a> yesterday: "These are exciting times for biomedical research and NIH," gushed acting NIH Director Raynard Kington. But few scientists will be celebrating in a few months, as a mere 1%–2% of the Challenge grants will likely be funded.</p>  <p>Those who lose out won't have completely wasted their time, as they can resubmit their ideas as a regular R01 investigator-initiated grant. These proposals may face tough odds, too, however, CSR Director Antonio Scarpa told his advisory council yesterday. </p> 

  <p>The recycled Challenge proposals could bloat the number of R01 applications far above the normal 9000 or so per cycle, Scarpa said. His rough projections are that the biggest crunch will come in 2010 with a possible 30,000 applications to be reviewed in February and 25,000 in October (see graph). As a result, success rates for these grants, normally over 20%, could plummet.<br /></p>  <p>Scarpa said NIH is trying to figure out ways to ease the burden on the reviewers of these R01s. They won't be able to draw on the Challenge grant reviews because the recycled proposals will be considered new applications that must be reviewed all over again, says CSR spokesperson Donald Luckett. The numbers are "guesstimates," cautions Luckett. "We're trying to be prepared for possibilities." <br /></p>  <p>(<a href="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/RecycledR01s.jpg">Click here</a> for a larger version of the graph.

In this week's online <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, Duke University demographer Kenneth Manton and colleagues <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0905104106">compared</a> death rates from 1950 to 2004 for four big killers—heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes—with the rising budgets of their corresponding NIH institutes. For all but diabetes deaths, which have risen recently because of rising rates of obesity, they found an inverse correlation between budgets and age-adjusted death rates 10 years later. And when they plotted the total NIH budget versus overall mortality rates (see graph), they found an "excellent" regression fit. The researchers estimate that from 1950 to 2004, some 35 million deaths were avoided thanks to NIH. That's a sizable number compared to the 131 million deaths in that period.</p>  <p>The kicker is that the researchers link their results to a projected slowdown in the growth of the U.S. labor force. To offset this by keeping people healthy and working longer, they write, "the size of NIH expenditures relative to GDP should quadruple to about 1% (~ $120 billion) and be done sufficiently rapidly (10 years)." </p>    <p>Credit: K.

  <p>Human genomes produced to date have all required many instruments running in parallel and have cost up to $500,000 per genome, says <a href="http://thebigone.stanford.edu/">Stephen Quake</a>, a biophysicist at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, and founder of <a href="http://www.helicosbio.com/">Helicos Biosciences</a> of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The HeliScope Single Molecule Sequencer is the first commercial single-molecule sequencing instrument, so called because it does not require the production of millions of copies of the target DNA for the analysis. Instead, DNA is cut into small pieces and mounted at very high densities in a flow cell, where a very sensitive camera monitors the step by step addition of bases for each sequencing reaction.</p>  <p><a href="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/DSC01119.jpg"><img title="Stephen Quake" style="border: 0px none ; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px; display: inline;" alt="Stephen Quake" src="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/DSC01119_thumb.jpg" width="160" align="left" border="0" height="240" /></a> In the new paper, Quake (<i>left</i>) and colleagues report how the machine generated enough data to cover the 3-billion base human genome 28 times over. That sequence data consisted of short stretches of sequences 24 to 70 bases long, which were compared with the reference human genome sequence in public databases to piece together Quake’s own genome. </p>  <p> The demonstration brings “plug and play” sequencing one step closer to reality, wherein individual labs will be able to do what today is accomplished primarily in large sequencing centers. “This is the main coming out party for the Helicos machine,” says <a href="http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/nanomedicine/biographies/schloss.asp">Jeffery Schloss</a> of the <a href="http://genome.gov/">National Human Genome Research Institute</a> in Bethesda, Maryland. </p>  <p>However, the machines cost $1 million. That’s several times the price of other sequencing machines, notes Schloss. While such machines hint at a future where individual labs sequence large genomes, Schloss emphasizes that large centers will <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/320/5881/1272">continue to play a role</a> in improving technologies and their uses and developing analytical tools for genome projects. </p>    <p>Photo Credit: S.

U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy ruled in Missoula, Montana, that the plans to kill more than 20% of the estimated 1350 wolves in the two states would not cause the species long-term harm. </p>  <p>However, Molloy also found that the federal government appears to have violated the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in May when it lifted protections for the wolves in Idaho and Montana, but kept Wyoming’s wolves safe. The selective delisting of two of the three Northern Rocky Mountain wolf populations appeared to be “a practical determination that does not seem to be scientifically based,” Judge Molloy stated in his 14-page ruling.&nbsp; He added that the consortium of conservation organizations was “likely to prevail” in its overall lawsuit, which the group filed in June. The suit challenges the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s decision to lift the ESA’s protective shield from the wolves. “The service has distinguished a natural population of wolves based on a political line, not the best available science,” Molloy wrote.&nbsp; “That, by definition, seems arbitrary and capricious.” </p>

  <p>In February, a landmark report by the National Research Council (NRC) in February <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12589">criticized nearly every aspect of the nation's forensics science system</a>, including unreliable techniques for analyzing hair and DNA samples—a problem the U.S. Senate has been <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=4038">addressing </a>in recent hearings. </p>  <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="lentini.jpg" src="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/lentini.jpg" class="mt-image-left" width="125" height="178" /></span><p>But the NRC report said almost nothing about arson.

Actually, there are wrongful convictions for arson all over the United States. Because there is no DNA involved, and because the investigators only document the scene to the extent necessary to "prove" arson, it is exceedingly difficult to obtain a reversal of a wrongful conviction.</p>  <p>Most fire investigators were trained by mentors who were trained by mentors, who passed on belief systems based on anecdotal experience rather than on chemistry and physics.</p>

The problems with the Willingham case arose from inadequate training and experience of the fire scene investigators. ... The issues that the NAS Committee dealt with concerned the status of laboratory forensic science rather than crime scene investigation. Although CSI should be more scientifically based and should fall within the purview of forensic science, it is generally considered to be part of the law enforcement process. Crime scene investigation training stresses observation and data collection but not critical thinking and scientific analysis.

Momentum is growing worldwide to look closely at the idea, a 150-year-old technique of igniting seams of coal deep under the ground to produce electrical power or chemicals. It's a proven technology: Joseph Stalin launched the first national research program into the idea in 1928 and the Soviets used it for 40 years to produce power. Since then, cheap natural gas and shallow, easy-to-mine coal burned in traditional power plants have prevented the technique from taking off. (graphic courtesy Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory)<br /></p>  <p>But gasifying coal underground is now a hot topic among power companies and scientists, with at least 10 pilot projects around the world planned or underway. The cost benefits and climate advantages are among the reasons that five countries run national research programs on the technique; is the United States falling behind on the next big fossil fuel technology?</p>  <p>Yes, says the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force, a well-respected public health and environment advocacy group, <a href="http://www.catf.us/publications/reports/Coal_Without_Carbon.pdf">in a report</a> issued last week.</p>

The bottom line—at least 19% of NIH's basic research portfolio is funded for reasons that go beyond quality—may stoke simmering concerns about the agency's policy that favors young investigators.</p>  <p>The finding is part of a U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) <a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-687">report</a> released today that examined management practices at NIH’s 27 institutes and centers. One touchy question is how often they depart from "priority scores" assigned by peer-review panels. Institutes usually set a "payline" or minimum score that a proposal must receive to be funded. But they also fund proposals below that line, for reasons that include balancing the institute's portfolio and giving new investigators a leg up.</p>  <p>Until this week, the NIH-wide numbers hadn't been made public. The most surprising aspect of the GAO report, besides the overall number of exceptions, is its discovery of a sudden increase 2 years ago. In 2003, 625 of 6461 R01s, NIH's basic research grant, fell below the quality cutoff. In 2007, the most recent year examined, the total had jumped to 1059 of 5715 awards (see graph).</p>

Yesterday, Joe Barton (R–TX) and Greg Walden (R–OR), minority members of the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee, <a href="http://republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/Media/file/News/092409_Barton_Walden_NIH_Grants.pdf">wrote </a>NIH to ask to express their concerns about the peer review of a dozen grants that they believe "do not seem to be of the highest scientific rigor." </p>  <p>The peer review system requires that the project address "an important problem," but some of the grants "do not seem to meet this standard," the letter says. It points to four examples: one looking at whether dragon boat racing helps women who have survived cancer, and three others studying drug or alcohol abuse among sex workers in Thailand, in a Native American tribe, and at rave parties in Brazil. The congressman ask for details of peer review for the 12 grants, including scores given by individual peer reviewers, the so-called overall impact score, and the number of grants the panel reviewed. Impact scores, which reflect the overall quality of a grant, are normally known tp only NIH staff and the applicant. </p>  <p>The letter comes 2 months after the full House <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/07/conservative-at.html#more" target="_blank">approved an amendment</a> to kill funding for three NIH studies involving drug abuse and prostitutes—one of several such measures proposed or passed in the <a href="http://www.cossa.org/CPR/cpr.html" target="_blank">last 6 years</a>.</p>

<p>The Nobel Prizes need an overhaul, according to a panel of scientists assembled by New Scientist magazine. In an <a href="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/Nobel%20Foundation%20letter-1.pdf">open letter</a> to the Nobel Foundation published today, the scientists say that the prizes, scheduled to be awarded next week, don’t sufficiently reflect today’s science. Too many important areas of research are left out of the categories that Alfred Nobel specified in his 1896 will, they say. They ask the foundation to establish two new prizes, one for the Global Environment and one for Public Health advances, and for both they suggest allowing organizations to be eligible, as they are for the Peace prize. </p><p>They also want to expand eligibility for the Physiology or Medicine prize to all biologists. In an <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427284.000-experts-call-for-nobel-prizes-to-be-revamped.html">accompanying article</a>, Jim Giles points out that plant scientists were miffed when the 2006 prize was awarded for RNA silencing. The fundamental work had been done in plants, but the award went to researchers who transferred the technique to worms—and were therefore eligible for the Physiology or Medicine prize. “Fundamental breakthroughs in areas such as neuroscience and ecology … are also going unrecognized,” the scientists write. </p>

The <a href="http://www.ns.umich.edu/htdocs/releases/story.php?id=7336">study</a>, commissioned by the NFL and conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan, found that the proportion of former NFL players who had been diagnosed with a dementia-related disorder (according to their own accounts) was five times higher than that in the general population for players ages 50 and older, and 19 times higher for players between the ages of 30 and 49. </p>  <p>On one hand, the news suggests that the NFL, after long dismissing the problem, is now taking the issue more seriously. Yet <i>The</i> <i>Times</i> may have exaggerated the importance of the dementia findings, says lead author David Weir. Dementia wasn't the focus of the study, and if it had been, it would have been designed differently. The goal was to get an overall picture of retired players' physical and mental well-being, and researchers concluded that retired NFL players are generally a happy and healthy lot. </p>  <p>The dementia figures are based on a single question, posed to 1063 players in a telephone survey, that asked if they'd ever been diagnosed with “dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, or other memory-related disease.” In the 50 and older group, 6.1% of former players responded affirmatively, compared with 1.2% of men in the general population. In the younger group, the reported prevalence of reported dementia was much lower, but the difference between players and non-players was greater: 1.9% vs. 0.1%. The study has not been peer-reviewed, and because it was conducted by telephone, the researchers had to rely on the players' own accounts of their medical histories, which may or may not be accurate. </p>  <p>At the same time, the findings fit with several other lines of evidence that have emerged in recent years suggesting that head injuries on the playing field can lead to problems many years later.

Although it was only a modest reduction, it was the first positive result from any AIDS vaccine trial.</p>  <p>Now some researchers who have seen more of the data in confidential briefings are complaining that a fuller analysis undermines even cautious claims of success, and they are raising questions about the way the results were <a href="https://www01.hjf.org/apps/internet/hivnewscenter.nsf/phase3pressrelease">announced</a>.</p>  <p>The press conference and press releases discussed an analysis that included all 16,000 people who participated in the trial, except for seven who were infected before receiving any doses of the two vaccines that were used in combination. Seventy-four people in the placebo arm of the study became infected with HIV, while the similarly sized vaccinated group only had 51 infections—a 31.2% efficacy. The analysis indicated that there was about a 96% level of confidence that the effect was real and not due to chance—just above the 95% cutoff that is widely used as a measure of statistical significance. </p>  <p>In the private briefings, researchers learned that a second analysis, which is usually performed in vaccine studies and was part of the <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00223080?term=rv+144&amp;rank=2">Thai study’s design</a>, also found that vaccine recipients had fewer infections, but the reduction was not statistically significant and the level of efficacy was slightly lower. This analysis eliminated people in both groups who did not rigorously follow the protocols. “Anything that really works, you’ll have enough robustness in results to be significant with both analyses,” says Douglas Richman, an AIDS researcher at the University of California, San Diego, a longtime critic of the study. Richman did not discuss the specific results with <i>Science</i>. </p>

The displays will include replicas of 76 fossil skulls representing the human family tree as well as life-size reconstructions of faces of early human species. They will also show how climate change and other aspects of the environment affected our evolution.

Organizations such as the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and the Gates Foundation set up a new fund to help poor countries pay for vaccines. <br /></p><p>According to the report, 106 million infants were vaccinated against diseases such as measles and whooping cough in 2008—a record number. For the first time in decades, the number of children dying each year has fallen below 10 million, due in part to immunizations as well as factors such as clean water. But 24 million children in developing countries did not receive all of their shots, and $1 billion more a year is needed to reach them.</p>  <p>Countries have also overcome a vaccine shortage in the late 1990s. The vaccine market has tripled over the past 8 years, bringing in more than $17 billion in revenue. New vaccines are now available to thwart infections such as rotavirus and human papillomavirus, which can cause cancer. While more remains to be done, "the overall picture is one of cautious optimism, enthusiasm, energy, and dedication," the report says.</p><p>Photo: America.gov<br /></p>

The <ins cite="mailto:epennisi" datetime="2009-11-03T16:16"><a href="http://genome10k.org/">Genome 10K</a></ins> plan, formally announced today and described online in the 5 November issue of the <i><a href="http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/">Journal of Heredity</a></i>, is short on details: where funding will come from; what sequencing strategy to use; how to process and make use of data generated.</p>  <p>But its proponents have already set in motion a global effort to gather the DNA needed to ultimately provide a huge number of genomes to compare with human DNA. Such comparisons help pinpoint important regions of the human genome and provide evolutionary insights. To date about 60 vertebrates have been <a href="http://www.genome.gov/10002154">sequenced</a> or are being sequenced to some degree. Now <a href="http://biomedical.ucsc.edu/Haussler.html">David Haussler</a> from the University of California, Santa Cruz; <a href="http://home.ncifcrf.gov/CCR/lgd/staffInfo/staff/obriens.asp">Stephen O’Brien</a> from the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Maryland; <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/conservation/about/administrators/oliver_ryder_ph.d/">Oliver Ryder</a> from the San Diego Zoo in California; and about 50 others from around the world have compiled a list of 16,000 species spread across 43 institutions for which they know they can very likely get the DNA needed for sequencing. </p> 

  <p>Michael MacCracken, of the <a href="http://www.climate.org/">Climate Institute</a> in Washington, D.C., is leading the meeting’s independent scientific organizing committee, which will craft a final document after the meeting. Other organizers include ecologist Thomas Lovejoy of the <a href="http://www.heinzctr.org/index.shtml">Heinz Center</a> and Steve Hamburg of the <a href="http://www.edf.org/home.cfm">Environmental Defense Fund</a> in New York City, who called the Asilomar meeting “an important and thoughtful conversation about an urgent issue.” </p>  <p>MacCracken wants federal agencies to support field experiments on various questions. "I'd like to have a sort of checklist to be sure that best practices are being followed," he said. "We need to have this kind of discussion right now, while it's early." The international <a href="http://www.imo.org/home.asp?topic_id=1488">London Convention</a> antidumping treaty is working on specific rules for ocean fertilization techniques.</p>  <p>Critics of the Response Fund and its conference worry about its ties to Climos, a geoengineering startup company started in 2005 by entrepreneur <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/danwhaley">Dan Whaley</a>, Leinen’s son. With Leinen as its chief scientific officer, Climos <a href="http://www.climos.com/imo/Climos/Climos_Commercial_Rationale.pdf">sought</a> to perform ocean <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/03/debate-do-gobbl-1.html">iron fertilization</a> experiments and sell carbon credits it could show it earned.</p>  <p>Facing international opposition to the idea of selling credits for the controversial technique, the firm decided last year to morph into an ocean logistics company, with scientists doing the ocean experiments funded by charity, presumably through Leinen’s nonprofit, or other means. Whaley said he helped conceive of and launch the nonprofit, introducing Leinen to its fundraiser, Danielle Guttman. “Since then I’ve had no role,” he said of the Response Fund. Leinen said she no longer had “any financial interest” in the company, and Whaley agreed.</p>  <p>Since geoengineering involves techniques that could have global repercussions, say experts, it’s particularly important that any discussions about regulating the new technologies avoid the appearance of possible commercial interests or conflicts. These issues are particularly <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7262/full/461347a.html">acute</a> with commercial ocean fertilization. <br /></p>  <p>"It would be better for people with less of an appearance of a conflict of interest [to] play this role," said Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, California, when discussing the Response Fund’s role. "There's a perception that you've got a fox in the henhouse—for-profit companies or their nonprofit surrogates looking at governance of geoengineering." Physicist David Keith of the University of Calgary in Canada&nbsp; "welcomes" the effort but called Leinen’s nonprofit “nontransparent and appears to be closely tied to Climos, which was conceived to do ocean fertilization for profit. While I am happy to see profit-driven startups drive innovation, I think tying ocean fertilization to carbon credits was a sterling example of how not to govern climate engineering.” Read Keith's full statement <a href="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/full-comment-by.html">here</a>. </p>

  <p>The ruling is not technically binding in other counties with pending tobacco cases, but Bill Ogle, a lawyer working on Proctor's behalf, hoped the Duval ruling would have persuasive sway in other counties and help develop a consensus for Proctor's side.</p>  <p>The judge in the Duval case issued the ruling partly to move the case forward to trial more quickly but also, Ogle says, because of the free-speech issues the request for the manuscript raised. A scholar or an author has certain constitutionally protected rights, Ogle says, and they have the right to withhold speech until they see fit to publish. Ogle says he suspects that the friend-of-the-court&nbsp;<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-file" style="display: inline;"><a href="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/Arvin%20letter1.pdf">brief</a>&nbsp;</span>that Stanford University sent on Proctor's behalf helped sway the Florida court, because the decision cited arguments from the brief (though not the brief itself by name).</p><p>There is no written record of the decision at this point, but one will likely be available within a week from the Duval Circuit Court.</p>

In doing so, this M.D./Ph.D. steps into shoes vacated by now NIH Director Francis Collins in August 2008 after 15 years. </p>  <p>An energizer bunny among scientists, Green will have to turn his energy and enthusiasm toward dealing both with the post stimulus-money funding decline and with the ever more pressing need to turn sequencing information into relevant biological and biomedical information. Continued advances in DNA sequencing technology will make sequencing a routine biological assay. “The biggest challenges are to figure out how to ensure biological insights and functional studies keep pace with an ever accelerating pace in our ability to generate sequence,” says <a href="http://medschool.umaryland.edu/FACULTYRESEARCHPROFILE/viewprofile.aspx?id=20004">Claire Fraser-Liggett</a> from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. “Green is a very forward-looking thinker and has the ability to begin to strategize about what all of this new technology will allow us to do.”</p>

  <p>Three years ago, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, cut the ribbon on a brand new biosafety level 3 laboratory, a move the university hoped would position it to bring in more federal money for research on biodefense and infectious diseases. Now, the university's president has decided to turn away federal money for an anthrax research project involving primates, leaving OSU researchers confused, concerned, and angry.</p>  <p>Last month, faculty received an e-mail from university President Burns Hargis saying that the project would not go forward, despite winning funding from the National Institutes of Health and approval from the university's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, according to the Web site of <i>The Oklahoman</i>, which appears to have <a href="http://newsok.com/anthrax-study-rejected-by-osu/article/3421451">broken the story</a>. The project was to be led by Shinichiro Kurosawa, a pathologist at Boston University who previously worked at OSU and continues to collaborate with researchers there. <i>The Oklahoman</i> reported that the project aimed to test anthrax vaccines and treatments on baboons (Kurosawa did not immediately return phone and e-mail messages seeking more details).</p>  <p>The university did not make Hargis or other administrators available to answer questions today, but said in a <a href="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/osu-statement-o.html">statement</a>:</p> 

<p>Since 2007, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has deployed teams of anthropologists and other social scientists in Iraq and Afghanistan. The goal is to make better military decisions based on an improved cultural understanding of those countries. DOD officials claim the initiative—known as the Human Terrain System (HTS) program—is working, and has already helped defuse conflict in many areas. But in a&nbsp;<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-file" style="display: inline;"><a href="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/AAA%20report.doc">report released today</a>&nbsp;a</span>t its annual meeting in Philadelphia, the American Anthropological Association (AAA) says what HTS teams do in the field should not be confused with anthropology.

A new index, launched yesterday in Copenhagen, now provides policymakers and investors with information on which of the world’s regions will give them the most bang for their buck when selecting forests for conservation. </p>  <p>“The <a href="http://www.rff.org/RFF/Documents/RFF-Rpt-ForestCarbonIndex_web.pdf">Forest Carbon Index</a> (FCI) estimates the potential of every square kilometer of terrestrial land to generate carbon credits by either avoiding deforestation or by growing new forests,” said Erin Madeira, one of the architects of the project at Resources for the Future (RFF), a non-profit environmental organization in Washington, D.C. It maps out one-and-a-half-million grid squares, each 85.5 square kilometers in size. (The graphic shown here indicates the Index values for an area of Africa, with sections that represent the best investment for REDD in green).<br /></p>  <p>By compensating developing nations for not cutting down these trees, wealthy nations could cover many billions of tons of their required reduction in carbon emissions by 2020. The Index could help nations focus these efforts. It involves 20 geodatasets on national scales and six on subnational scales. These were mapped out each nation’s potential to attract foreign investment in its forests, based on possible profits and risks.</p> 

  <p>Chalk up another patent victory for the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Its hard-hitting intellectual property adjunct—the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF)—appears to have <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-ap-wi-drugcompanylawsui,0,4685582.story">clobbered</a> a biotech partner, <a href="http://www.xenon-pharma.com/index.html">Xenon</a> Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Burnaby, Canada, that it says tried to exploit a discovery from Wisconsin’s biochem labs without paying the university some disputed fees.</p>  <p>Researchers at Wisconsin and Xenon collaborated 9 years ago to study an enzyme, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), whose cholesterol-lowering properties they both patented. Xenon helped finance this research. But a federal appeals court <a href="/sciencenow-dev/scienceinsider/entry-assets/xenon%20case.pdf">ruled yesterday</a> that Xenon improperly tried to cut its own licensing deal with Novartis, excluding WARF, to create SCD-based drugs. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals backed a lower court that ruled several years ago that Xenon violated a partnership agreement by failing to share income from the Novartis “sublicense” deal. And the appeals court went even further than the lower court.</p>

The idea that H1N1 outbreak is not a pandemic is "scientifically wrong and historically inaccurate," WHO's Keiji Fukuda told reporters during a press conference.</p>  <p>With H1N1 apparently on the decline, and the damage much less severe than once feared, many countries are canceling part of their vaccine orders while others are trying to resell unused stocks. As a result, national governments and WHO have come under scrutiny for the way they handled the pandemic.</p>  <p>WHO's chief accuser of late is Wolfgang Wodarg (pictured above left), a German physician and former member of the German Parliament for the Social Democratic Party, who has called the pandemic a "fake"—because the virus isn't very different from existing strains—and who has suggested that big pharma coaxed WHO into declaring a pandemic so that it could produce and sell vaccine. "WHO in cooperation with some big pharmaceutical companies and their re-defined pandemics and lowered the alarm-threshold," Wodarg says in a <a href="http://www.wodarg.de/english/2948146.html">statement</a> on his Web site.</p>
