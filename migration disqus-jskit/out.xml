                <message>No, Steve, you are incorrect and Benjamin Suslick is incorrect. Colombia is where the coffee is grown and this is the primary mode of identification for any single origin coffee. Or, any coffee blend that is identifying the specific origins of the blend.
One wouldn't call a single origin coffee a 'St. Louis' coffee because that is where it is roasted and packaged. Well, they might for marketing purposes, but it doesn't change the coffee's Colombian-ness.</message>

I was going to read it until I noticed the misspelling of the coffee producing country, Colombia.

                <message>I'm not an expert, but is not the country of primary or final processing i.e., roast and grind refinement the primary clairfier of significance? Thus Columbian meaning -of or about the United States: relating to the United States, or its people or culture, especially if the beans are roasted, though not nescessarily originated here...Therefore Columbian doesn't particullarly mean 'Colombian' in origin or specifics.

                <message>When I tested an artificial nose, it was necessary to "train" it since it is only a correlation. After having it measure a response for "good" and "bad" quality of a particular aroma, it looked like the results were favorable. However, when we tested a completely different aroma, it said it was a "good" sample of the first aroma. It could not tell that the second product had nothing in common with the first. I wonder if tea samples would rate as good coffee?</message>

This correlation will be most likely found untrue, most likely the lack of sleep coincides with marijuana use as a form of self-meidcation. Lack of sleep is a gateway drug.</message>

                <message>Wow, I had like a dozen pot-smoking friends. That's a 504% chance that I'd also start. What is more, having two such friends isn't that hard and you're almost sure to be seduced, too, and then your friends are also affected by yourself. Small world theory and stuff, it's pretty safe to assume that basically everybody did it. Might not be that unrealistic but did we need a 42% formula for that conclusion?</message>

                <message>That is a surprising finding -- I would have expected stressed men to prefer more self-similar faces.

But as long as we're telling evolutionary tales, here's another explanation: Humans select self-similar mates to the extent that they have confidence in their own genes, and higher stress levels predict less confidence.  The basic idea is that you're always assessing how you have the best chance of passing on your genes: self-similar mates should share lots of your genes, but then your kids might end up facing the same stresses that you've faced.  If these stresses are too intense, then your offspring might fare better by being less similar to you -- so you choose a less self-similar mate.</message>

                <message>That is a surprising finding -- I would have expected stressed men to prefer more self-similar faces.

But as long as we're telling evolutionary tales, here's another explanation: Humans select self-similar mates to the extent that they have confidence in their own genes, and higher stress levels predict less confidence.  The basic idea is that you're always assessing how you have the best chance of passing on your genes: self-similar mates should share lots of your genes, but then your kids might end up facing the same stresses that you've faced.  If these stresses are too intense, then your offspring might fare better by being less similar to you -- so you choose a less self-similar mate.</message>

                <message>Sounds stupid. I always heard that the best sexual partner is the one who is less like you, since the whole point of sexual reproduction is the genetic variety. I know that I don't want to have sex with myself, nor do I want to have children with someone like me, and I am under no particular constant stress.
If it were proving some real point, we'd be all inbreeding happily, hoping that our twins would do the same thing.</message>

                <message>In addition, algal blooms produce isoprene, the next most abundant biologically derived greenhouse-gas  hydrocarbon after methane. Although short-lived, one of its breakdown products is ozone, both toxic and a greenhouse gas itself. Dead aglae reaching th sediment could also be expected to contribute to sediment methane releases. Surface algae decay will release the organic molecules used by a group of aerobic bacteria that, as a by-product of their metabolism, emit methane (study reported last year).

                <message>No analogy needed...domoic acid-producing blooms are typically considered harmful algal blooms when they impact humans.  Different types of harmful algae have different physiologies/biochemistry, so their response to the environment will be different--in this case, iron stimulates toxin production, in other cases it may be the N:P ratio.</message>

                <message>Vlad, I hear your frustration about job struggles but have to dispute just one point.  You say he's wasting money on all sorts of things but not science, and yet his proposed budgets for all the science agencies are WAY up while everything else is being held flat or decreased.   And the efforts on STEM education are way up too.  So the issue of stimulating, cutting and reallocating science jobs is one thorny question.  The other one is about allocating fixed dollars towards education, basic science research and applied engineering (like NASA).  There aren't simply cookie-cutter answers to those.  And saying it's all political talk and no action isn't quite fair.</message>

                <message>Another case of actions speaking louder than words.  Politicians and business leaders are constantly pillow-biting and whining about how the smartest kids are not going into math, science and engineering - but they won't pay for science.  The reason smart kids avoid technology careers is that they are not stupid.  Who wants to go into massive debt to become an out of work rocket scientist?  

Also, many of those 50+ year old technology workers who were laid off, relocated repeatedly, outsourced, downsized, or whatever have children in school and those kids do not see a reason to pursue a career that did not pan out for their parents even if they have the aptitude and the interest themselves.  I recruit for my alma mater, and I hear this story a lot.

If Obama really wanted kids to study science, not laying off 7,000 people at KSC this year would be a good first step- especially since there has not been anything else that he has been unwilling to spend money on.  The dude will waste money on Wall St. bailouts, troop surges, cash for clunkers, and all kinds of things, but not science!  It is OBVIOUSLY his lowest priority.  

To be fair, if industry really wanted kids to study science they would rush out to hire those 7,000 people when they become available.  I'm not holding my breath.  I expect to have a Starbucks barista tell me how the rheological properties of a latte determine the density and height of its foam any day now.  </message>

                <message>Another case of actions speaking louder than words.  Politicians and business leaders are constantly pillow-biting and whining about how the smartest kids are not going into math, science and engineering - but they won't pay for science.  The reason smart kids avoid technology careers is that they are not stupid.  Who wants to go into massive debt to become an out of work rocket scientist?  

Also, many of those 50+ year old technology workers who were laid off, relocated repeatedly, outsourced, downsized, or whatever have children in school and those kids do not see a reason to pursue a career that did not pan out for their parents even if they have the aptitude and the interest themselves.  I recruit for my alma mater, and I hear this story a lot.

If Obama really wanted kids to study science, not laying off 7,000 people at KSC this year would be a good first step- especially since there has not been anything else that he has been unwilling to spend money on.  The dude will waste money on Wall St. bailouts, troop surges, cash for clunkers, and all kinds of things, but not science!  It is OBVIOUSLY his lowest priority.  

To be fair, if industry really wanted kids to study science they would rush out to hire those 7,000 people when they become available.  I'm not holding my breath.  I expect to have a Starbucks barista tell me how the rheological properties of a latte determine the density and height of its foam any day now.  </message>

                <message>Might I ask if it is common practice for medical journals to write articles that appear to set different research papers and their authors against each other? Mr Kean describes the situation like a baseball match with phrases such as 'second major hit' and 'fallen apart under scrutiny'. It doesn't set a particularly dignified or impartial tone for such an esteemed publication.

Might I also ask whether David Griffiths has been party to the protocols used by the WPI to isolate XMRV in ME? If not, then I would further ask how he is able to state "All the people involved are doing things exactly as they should be". Surely only the WPI can judge this.

Finally, might I request that Mr Kean/Science looks more closely at the sample selection of this latest UK research? Fukuda criteria only were used, whereas the WPI used Fukuda and Canadian, the latter being a much 'tighter' diagnostic protocol that focuses on neurological symptoms and 'weeds out' psychiatric illnesses. 

To demonstrate the issue of ineffective sample selection, at a localised level, the 'Dorset cohort' used by SGUL is drawn from the Dorset CFS (sic) Centre which offers graded exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy to treat ME, a fact which dissuades people with 'a "real" disease' (as Mr Kean so quaintly puts it) from attending. It is more than likely, therefore, that blood samples from genuine ME patients in this location are still in the patients and not in the test tubes.

It was very encouraging to see Science take on the challenge of breaking the stigma attached to ME and publishing the original XMRV article in October 2009. I hope that the journal continues in this vein and resists the temptation to make a spectator sport out of the subsequent research trials and errors.</message>

Art, SERPINA1 (Z-A1AT) and Intense Creative Energy (ICE) : blessing or curse? Frédéric Chopin's disease may have been chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) induced by XMRV (Xenotropic MuLV-Related Virus), worsened by vertical transmission of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus 
(KSHV/HHV-8), leading to : 

[1] Pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma in CFS/ME, or, Kaposi's sarcoma of the lung in CFS/ME

[2] Gastro-intestinal Kaposi's sarcoma in CFS/ME

[3] Pharyngeal Kaposi's Sarcoma in CFS/ME, 

because Chopin's symptoms were constantly progressing, confining him to his bed, eventually leading him to die at the age of 39 from CFS/ME due to a co-infection with XMRV/HHV-6A/CMV/HHV-8, as evidenced by Chopin's mysterious, debilitating chronic multiorgan disease, involving  :

(a) the brain (severe headaches) => CFS/ME + KSHV/HHV-8

(b) the lung (recurrent pulmonary infections) =>  CFS/ME + KSHV/HHV-8

(c) the gastro-intestinal tract  => the larynx => CFS/ME + KSHV/HHV-8

(d) the heart (enlarged heart) => CFS/ME + KSHV/HHV-8

(e) hemoptysis =>  the coughing up of blood from the respiratory tract  => pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma
      => XMRV + KSHV/HHV-8

(f) recurrent fevers => KSHV/HHV-8

(g) at age 16 he had an illness lasting 6 months, including following prominent symptoms : => CFS/ME

(1) respiratory complaints  => KSHV/HHV-8, 

(2) severe headaches => CFS/ME, 

(3) cervical adenopathy => CFS/ME 

(h) General complaints : 

(4) effort intolerance => CFS/ME  

(5) fatigue => CFS/ME 

(i)  failure to gain weight => CFS/ME + KSHV/HHV-8.

(j) abdominal pain and diarrhea => Irritable Bowel Syndrome => 

Patients with IBS have a higher frequency of a coexisting medical illness such as FM, CFS, and chronic pain syndromes. Depression, anxiety, and panic ... => abdominal pain and diarrhea => CFS/ME + KSHV/HHV-8 

(k) Frédéric Chopin was exhausted and listless, and was confined to his bed for [very longs periods of time]  => CFS/ME

SERPINA1 (Z-A1AT) and HFE (C282Y) gene mutations may be the cause of XMRV-related CFS/ME.

                <message>This is a nasty disease which may have more than one cause. If it is triggered (as seems likely) by one or more viruses it may set off a disease which does not heal by merely removing the virus.  
 
A fair amount of ink has been dispensed in recent dust-up regarding XMRV, but there has been little new interest expressed in finding cures for people who now have it. A few people, such as those at WPI, have been working on this for a number of years. It's been a thankless task so far, due to the difficulty of the problem itself and the lack of medical and scientific interest.  
 
This is obviously difficult research and we need reach further, beyond looking for one specific pathogen. Perhaps the virus which is believed to have been found in the WPI study exists in several different forms, is part of a family of related but not identical pathogens or is only one of several factors that trigger this disease. Perhaps an entirely different vector can trigger an immune system/CNS collapse via similar paths, manifesting in highly similar but not identical symptoms.  Perhaps the pathogen(s) involved do not (all) circulate in quantity during most of the disease, but trigger a cascade of events while remaining hidden in living cells.   The first job in science is to ask a non-trivial question.

If science does unravel this I believe the knowledge required to do so will lead understanding and repair other mysterious diseases. If it does not, many productive lives will continue to be wasted.  </message>

February 18, 2010: WPI is aware of the recent UK study that was unable to detect the presence of XMRV in any CFS patient samples. Although researchers at the WPI were not involved in this project, our work in XMRV continues with researchers around the world. We look forward to the results of studies which replicate the methods used in the original research described in the journal Science in October, 2009.

Information Regarding XMRV Studies

1.

4. The collection, preparation and storage of DNA were completely different between the Science and UK papers. The latter studies do not show data on blood harvesting or storage. Nor do the studies disclose the quantity of isolated cells. Insufficient number of cells analyzed may result in failure to detect a low copy virus like XMRV, regardless of the sensitivity of the assay. Neither UK study provides detail to allow interpretation of how many white blood cells were analyzed.

5. Patient population selection may differ between studies.

6. The UK authors were unable to detect XMRV, even though 4% of healthy individuals were found to be infected in the US. Japanese scientists detected XMRV in 1.7% in healthy blood donors in Japan. The two previously identified human retroviruses have distinct geographical distributions.

7. Perhaps the most important issue to focus on is the low level of XMRV in the blood. XMRV is present in such a small percentage of white blood cells that it is highly unlikely that either UK study’s PCR method could detect it using the methods described. Careful reading of the Science paper shows that increasing the amount of the virus by growing the white blood cells is usually required rather than using white blood cells directly purified from the body. When using PCR alone, the Science authors found that four samples needed to be taken at different times from the same patient in order for XMRV to be detected by PCR in freshly isolated white blood cells. More importantly, detection methods other than PCR showed that patients whose blood lacks sufficient amount of XMRV detectable by PCR are actually infected. This was proven by the isolation of viral proteins and the finding of infectious XMRV isolated from the indicator cell line LNCaP. The authors of the Retrovirology paper admit that their neutralization assay did not detect bacterially expressed XMRV gag and that positive control sera was needed to validate their assay. The WPI’s monoclonal antibodies specifically and sensitively completed the immune response demonstrating the assays sensitivity and specificity for XMRV envelope.

Simply stated the only validated reliable methods for detecting XMRV in CFS patients, to date, are the methods described in Science. Failure to use these methods and validated reagents has resulted in the failure to detect XMRV. A failure to detect XMRV is not the same as absence of this virus in patients with CFS.

February 18, 2010: WPI is aware of the recent UK study that was unable to detect the presence of XMRV in any CFS patient samples. Although researchers at the WPI were not involved in this project, our work in XMRV continues with researchers around the world. We look forward to the results of studies which replicate the methods used in the original research described in the journal Science in October, 2009.

                <message>Frédéric Chopin's Disease : XMRV-induced Disease. XMRV-induced CFS/ME. Frederick Chopin (1810 - October 17, 1849) : The long suffering of Frédéric Chopin. Art, SERPINA1 (Z-A1AT) and Intense Creative Energy (ICE) : blessing or curse? Frédéric Chopin's disease may have been chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) induced by XMRV (Xenotropic MuLV-Related Virus), worsened by vertical transmission of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus 
(KSHV/HHV-8), leading to : 

[1] Pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma in CFS/ME, or, Kaposi's sarcoma of the lung in CFS/ME

[2] Gastro-intestinal Kaposi's sarcoma in CFS/ME

[3] Pharyngeal Kaposi's Sarcoma in CFS/ME, 

because Chopin's symptoms were constantly progressing, confining him to his bed, eventually leading him to die at the age of 39 from CFS/ME due to a co-infection with XMRV/HHV-6A/CMV/HHV-8, as evidenced by Chopin's mysterious, debilitating chronic multiorgan disease, involving  :

(a) the brain (severe headaches) =&amp;gt; CFS/ME + KSHV/HHV-8

(b) the lung (recurrent pulmonary infections) =&amp;gt;  CFS/ME + KSHV/HHV-8

(c) the gastro-intestinal tract  =&amp;gt; the larynx =&amp;gt; CFS/ME + KSHV/HHV-8

(d) the heart (enlarged heart) =&amp;gt; CFS/ME + KSHV/HHV-8

(e) hemoptysis =&amp;gt;  the coughing up of blood from the respiratory tract  =&amp;gt; pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma
      =&amp;gt; XMRV + KSHV/HHV-8

(f) recurrent fevers =&amp;gt; KSHV/HHV-8

(g) at age 16 he had an illness lasting 6 months, including following prominent symptoms : =&amp;gt; CFS/ME

(1) respiratory complaints  =&amp;gt; KSHV/HHV-8, 

(2) severe headaches =&amp;gt; CFS/ME, 

(3) cervical adenopathy =&amp;gt; CFS/ME 

(h) General complaints : 

(4) effort intolerance =&amp;gt; CFS/ME  

(5) fatigue =&amp;gt; CFS/ME 

(i)  failure to gain weight =&amp;gt; CFS/ME + KSHV/HHV-8.

(j) abdominal pain and diarrhea =&amp;gt; Irritable Bowel Syndrome =&amp;gt; 

Patients with IBS have a higher frequency of a coexisting medical illness such as FM, CFS, and chronic pain syndromes. Depression, anxiety, and panic ... =&amp;gt; abdominal pain and diarrhea =&amp;gt; CFS/ME + KSHV/HHV-8 

(k) Frédéric Chopin was exhausted and listless, and was confined to his bed for [very longs periods of time]  =&amp;gt; CFS/ME

SERPINA1 (Z-A1AT) and HFE (C282Y) gene mutations may be the cause of XMRV-related CFS/ME.

                <message>This is a nasty disease which may have more than one cause. If it is triggered (as seems likely) by one or more viruses it may set off a disease which does not heal by merely removing the virus.  
 
A fair amount of ink has been dispensed in recent dust-up regarding XMRV, but there has been little new interest expressed in finding cures for people who now have it. A few people, such as those at WPI, have been working on this for a number of years. It's been a thankless task so far, due to the difficulty of the problem itself and the lack of medical and scientific interest.  
 
This is obviously difficult research and we need reach further, beyond looking for one specific pathogen. Perhaps the virus which is believed to have been found in the WPI study exists in several different forms, is part of a family of related but not identical pathogens or is only one of several factors that trigger this disease. Perhaps an entirely different vector can trigger an immune system/CNS collapse via similar paths, manifesting in highly similar but not identical symptoms.  Perhaps the pathogen(s) involved do not (all) circulate in quantity during most of the disease, but trigger a cascade of events while remaining hidden in living cells.   The first job in science is to ask a non-trivial question.

If science does unravel this I believe the knowledge required to do so will lead understanding and repair other mysterious diseases. If it does not, many productive lives will continue to be wasted.  </message>

                <message>Might I ask if it is common practice for medical journals to write articles that appear to set different research papers and their authors against each other? Mr Kean describes the situation like a baseball match with phrases such as 'second major hit' and 'fallen apart under scrutiny'. It doesn't set a particularly dignified or impartial tone for such an esteemed publication.

Might I also ask whether David Griffiths has been party to the protocols used by the WPI to isolate XMRV in ME? If not, then I would further ask how he is able to state "All the people involved are doing things exactly as they should be". Surely only the WPI can judge this.

Finally, might I request that Mr Kean/Science looks more closely at the sample selection of this latest UK research? Fukuda criteria only were used, whereas the WPI used Fukuda and Canadian, the latter being a much 'tighter' diagnostic protocol that focuses on neurological symptoms and 'weeds out' psychiatric illnesses. 

To demonstrate the issue of ineffective sample selection, at a localised level, the 'Dorset cohort' used by SGUL is drawn from the Dorset CFS (sic) Centre which offers graded exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy to treat ME, a fact which dissuades people with 'a "real" disease' (as Mr Kean so quaintly puts it) from attending. It is more than likely, therefore, that blood samples from genuine ME patients in this location are still in the patients and not in the test tubes.

It was very encouraging to see Science take on the challenge of breaking the stigma attached to ME and publishing the original XMRV article in October 2009. I hope that the journal continues in this vein and resists the temptation to make a spectator sport out of the subsequent research trials and errors.</message>

                <message>This is so obvious, it's sickening.  Anyone who knows that steam turbines generate electricity should know that any source of heat hot enough to boil water can be used to generate electricity.  That's how a coal powerplant works... it just boils water.  Smelting plants that use electric arc furnaces should eventually be required, by law, to reclaim lost heat and re-generate some of their power back.</message>

                <message>I suppose you academics got paid to stuble across this revelation?  Cogeneration have been engineered for will over 40 years.  As with all processes, it isn't about whether the process can be done, it's whether it can be done economically; whether it is in the business interest of the heat generating facility; and whether they want to be bothered with operating a facility that is not a part of their core business.  Heat recovery plants that produce electricity are expensive, require constant maintenance, and require personnel additions that may make the the difference between a profit or loss making venture.  Must everything be legislated to occur?  Market forces will drive the the formation of companies that will make use of the wasted energy.  The best success in this area would be for a company with experience in operating and maintaining heat recovery generation plants to contract for the heat and build, operate, and maintain such facilities on a large scale basis, allowing them to capitalize on the economies of scale that such operation would provide.</message>

                <message>John you goofed up in Carnot efficiency calculations.It is 80% and not 50%. Hence there is a huge gap which can be used to produce low pressure steam and run a turbine. This happens in quite a number of plants world over. So it is nothing new.</message>

                <message>"Similarly, heat from burning fossil fuel at a power plant can be recycled, doubling the efficiency of electricity production and thereby halving CO2 emissions."  

This is a dubious claim considering second law efficiencies.  Most conventional power plants are about 35% efficient in converting heat to electricity while the maximum second law efficiency is about 50%.  If I read this correctly, you are claiming the efficiency can be increased to 70%.  This would violate the second law.  The problem is that most waste heat is at a low temperature which means it has a low potential to produce work.

                <message>jonjski, you make fair points, but we must also take into account that current regulations make cogeneration more difficult and less profitable than it should be.  We don't have a free electricity market.  We have protected utilities that are largely insulated from competition and given no incentive to do things efficiently.  

To be sure, I'm associated with the company chaired by Tom Casten, mentioned in the article.  At Recycled Energy Development (recycled-energy.com), this is the stuff that staff members live and breathe, so perhaps I'm biased.  But there really is remarkable potential here, if only market forces would be unleashed.  Estimates from LBNL, McKinsey, and elsewhere suggest recycling waste energy could slash our greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, even as energy costs fell due to increased efficiency.  How could we not pursue policies to make that a reality?</message>

My guess is that you just don't want immigrants. and you will find any sorry ass excuse to ban them.
YOu're white,blond, protestant, it's call wasp in your country, also know as asshole in the rest of the world.

                <message>If somebody has a good idea and wants to start a business, it should not matter where he/she is from to get the necessary funding and legal support. It is the venture venture capitalists who are deciding whether an idea may be profitable or not. It is not like this bill is going to open door for unskilled immigrant labor, it is just leveling the playing field for all educated people from around the world. On the other hand, I agree that there should be some check and balances for the quality and immigrant status of the people being hired once the company gets going, so that only the best talent gets hired and not just co-nationals. </message>

                <message>I think this is a great bill.There are various reasons to support that. Firstly, it will create jobs ,which will help American economy.Next the enterprenur will pay tax which is better than illegal people who don't.Again, when such enterprenurs give jobs to American citizens,they will also pay tax and spend more money on their basic needs like food,clothings,entertainment, which will again boost up economy of other businesses too.If they don't have jobs they ofcourse won't spend money.Now its better than eb5 because very less people have  1m dollars but ofcourse more people have and can afford 250K in business to get visa.Rather than giving away jobs to India and China it is certainly better to bring in able enterpreneur in USA and create jobs here.I hope more and more people to get this visa so that unemployment rate in usa can be reduced to zero.I ceratinly salute senator Kerry and Lugar to bring such a brilliant idea.I support this bill.</message>

                <message>I think this is a great bill.There are various reasons to support that. Firstly, it will create jobs ,which will help American economy.Next the enterprenur will pay tax which is better than illegal people who don't.Again, when such enterprenurs give jobs to American citizens,they will also pay tax and spend more money on their basic needs like food,clothings,entertainment, which will again boost up economy of other businesses too.If they don't have jobs they ofcourse won't spend money.Now its better than eb5 because very less people have  1m dollars but ofcourse more people have and can afford 250K in business to get visa.Rather than giving away jobs to India and China it is certainly better to bring in able enterpreneur in USA and create jobs here.I hope more and more people to get this visa so that unemployment rate in usa can be reduced to zero.I ceratinly salute senator Kerry and Lugar to bring such a brilliant idea.I support this bill.</message>

I think both eb-5 and eb-6 are great news for America and its economy - immigrants who are intelligent, wealthy and entrprenurial - whats not to love?

                <message>FRAUD &amp;amp; more FRAUD.      The U.S already has a visa for proven entrepreneur who invest $500,000 in a business that hires 10 people.    Why lower the barrier for an unproven ones whose ideas are likely to fail (90% of new businesses fail) and instead of leaving the U.S, they stay here and become an illegal who compete with Americans for jobs and take away resources from American taxpayers.

By the way, do you know that it costs $25,000 to human traffic someone to Europe (more for the U.S. in the range of 40,000) and there are a lot of uneducated people from 3rd countries who are able to raise this much money in order to traffic them to Europe (their families and entire villages go into debt hoping that this person will be able to pay back when he is able to get a job in Europe/U.S after a few year).      By lowering the standard, the U.S. is opening itself to this kind of exploitation.</message>

                <message>I completely agree with yerband in both issues: first it is annoying and disappointing that Science is deleting comments without any public explanation.... 

second, for some reason the most obvious experiment would have been the use of synthetic RNA instead mouse-derived liver RNA to create infectious recPrPres... this would have clarified many doubts about the nature and contamination concerns of this "synthetic prions". Just for the sake of the study and as a definitive proof! They did show that synthetic Poly-Adenine served as co-factors for replication only in vitro, but did not show whether they can promote the spontaneous generation of recPrPres or infectivity. These raises some questions:

- Were these samples ever injected? 
- Why did they start using liver-derived RNA in first place which is much more laborious to obtain instead of buying synthetic poly-adenine and show a more real "mammalian-free" system to generate synthetic prions?
- Why did the recPrPres samples was mixed with highly concentrated BSA when injected in mice?

                <message> IS RECOMBINANT PRION PROTEIN BY ITSELF INFECTIOUS?

The authors claim (science.1183748) that recombinant prion protein from E. coli, converted into a protease resistant form (rPrP-res), caused scrapie disease in mice. However, the mixture also contained normal mouse liver RNA and synthetic lipid. Before inoculation this mixture was subjected to multiple manipulations (serial dilutions, sonication etc.) in a laboratory that previously contained RML scrapie infected brain and other mouse tissues. Control inoculum #2 (rPrP, RNA, lipid, buffer) was only incubated without subjecting it to serial dilution and sonication, supposedly to prevent rPrPres formation. They also had rPrP-res negative sonicated samples with the same components as inoculum #2 and did not use any of these as a negative inoculation control. Moreover, the rPrP-res “seed” was not directly injected, another essential control.

Recombinant prion protein alone without either RNA or lipid was previously converted into a protease resistant form by others (1) and was not infectious. In contrast, RNA isolated from infected brains was required for infection (2). This leads one to suspect that contamination with RNA coming from RML infected scrapie material in the lab was responsible for the observed infectivity reported. Indeed, the immunohistochemical staining pattern of pathological prion protein in the figures looks the same as in brains infected with standard RML scrapie (3).

Here is what I posted: I can not believe that Science deleted ALL comments (two pages) posted earlier for this news article. 

Some of the previous comments that were deleted raised important questions about the the study such as missing important controls.
