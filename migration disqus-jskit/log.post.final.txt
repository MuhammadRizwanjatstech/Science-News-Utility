JSReplyMSGId('jst-1', 'jsid-1271888656-657', { "TS": 1271888656, "Text": "The argument put forth in the last paragraph could equally be countered by pointing out that members of small tribal societies treat the games as real and anticipate real consequenc<wbr></wbr>es (such as the risk of offering to cooperate with strangers) whereas college students have a clear idea of the division between the virtual and real worlds and have well adapted and distinct personalit<wbr></wbr>ies used to navigate the two separate worlds.\n\nHence an argument could be put forward that people not used to virtual (game) worlds more honestly depict their real behaviour.  It is my understand<wbr></wbr>ing that the nearest comparison to game theory behaviour that has been demonstrat<wbr></wbr>ed is the behaviour of stock market traders, which is renowned as an unreal environmen<wbr></wbr>t quite unlike the real world and a game that few people can play well (because they can\'t sufficient<wbr></wbr>ly divorce themselves from reality when large amounts of real money is involved.)\n" });

There is not a single male teacher at my children\'s elementary school, yet they are not burdened with task forces, review committees and hiring inquisitio<wbr></wbr>ns trying to establish gender parity.  When will we grow up enough as a society to accept that peoples choices come primarily from their cultural and personal preference<wbr></wbr>s, not from biases in \'the establishm<wbr></wbr>ent\', even if the results do not reflect our intellectu<wbr></wbr>al preconcept<wbr></wbr>ions." });

There is a limit (or there is with our science us little fallible beings created) It\'s just that the escape velocity exceeds that of the (known) fastest thing in the universe, which is light. And simply because the spaceship appears to stop doesn\'t mean that it did, in reality. Science is based off of observatio<wbr></wbr>ns, so it is true that the spaceship stops to an observer outside of the black holes point of no return, but what about the observers inside of the point of no return? They would still be there, and not stuck in one frame of time (or a quantum second, If remember correctly)<wbr></wbr>, so what does this say? Well, it is called the point of no return, which means that once you pass that invisible line the escape velocity of the black hole is too great to be overcome by anything (we think!) in the universe, so you cannot go back, essentiall<wbr></wbr>y splitting the two observers into places where they can never compare their data, this solves the paradox of appearing to stop, he does stop, yet he doesn\'t.

This “new theory”, actually almost 20years old, claimed that life on Earth might have been originated from multiple acellular ancestors and thus could not share a last common ancestor cell.  A direct extension of this theory is that human beings are not monophylog<wbr></wbr>enetic at all and there is no such thing as a last common human being." });

Such as at age 12 an individual smokes pot -- one month later, the choice comes up agian to smoke pot and at that point you reach a \"splitting point\" -- continuing as a drug user or denying the pot. 10 years later, another joint is offered and the 2nd splitting moment comes in. At this point it can ricochet back to the first choice of smoking pot and continuing pot use (thus becoming simply one joint in a long procession of them). On the other hand it can be a refusal and continuing life without having smoked one. \r\n\r\nVery complex. " });

What can you expect from such a young species in a universe said to be billions of years old?  Just take a look at all the holes in table of elements.  One should note that \"reality\" concerning the universe as a whole has changed repeatedly since the invention of the telescope.  The old theory of the ball in a spaceship argues that things may move faster than light, provided some sort of device is used to prevent passengers from becoming smudges on the back wall at velocity speeds.  Now I\'m just a bit irritated about this whole mess.  First, a small group of folk decide for the rest of us that Pluto is no longer a planet.  Now, black holes don\'t exist?  Those were a few of my favorite things to read about as a child.  What next, maybe that galaxies are not really collection<wbr></wbr>s of stars, but rather rips in space-time looking through a skewed light field at our own juxtaposit<wbr></wbr>ion in space?  Or perhaps that we are simply billions of tiny motes lost in our understand<wbr></wbr>ing of our own ineptitude when it comes to observatio<wbr></wbr>n of our surroundin<wbr></wbr>gs.  It\'s the flat earth theory all over again.  Our understand<wbr></wbr>ing of the universe is like a candle to the sun, we have a long way to go before we get there.

But as some have allready pointed out, at the same time it will starve the life that needs sunlight in the ocean. Not to mentione all the rubbish it will create. As for mixing air into the surface water of the ocean, this will also increase the O2 level and CO2 level which in turn will change the chemical equilibriu<wbr></wbr>m in the sea. Which again will change the balance between which alge, bacteria and plancton that will thrive. I have not read the article by Mr. Seitz, but I hope he have discussed some of these side effects. Any \"geoengine<wbr></wbr>ering\" should include scientists from as many fields as possible to prevent any catastrofi<wbr></wbr>c effects.

Additional<wbr></wbr>ly, Medical Hypotheses had previously published other articles that questioned the HIV-AIDS hypothesis<wbr></wbr>.  Furthermor<wbr></wbr>e, many of the complainer<wbr></wbr>s of Medical Hypotheses had also petitioned the Library of Medicine to deselect Medical Hypothesis abstracts in MEDLINE/PU<wbr></wbr>BMED because Medical Hypotheses was not peer reviewed, but the petition was rejected reinforcin<wbr></wbr>g their complaint as spurious.  Finally, instead of complainin<wbr></wbr>g about the journal, the main complainer<wbr></wbr>s being ‘scientist<wbr></wbr>s’ could have readily published an article as a rejoinder to Duesberg et al to point out any specific “errors or misinterpr<wbr></wbr>etations” themselves<wbr></wbr>, rather than waiting for an anonymous panel 8 months later to do it.  Ignoring all these basic facts, Elsevier then turned a blind eye to what in all appearance<wbr></wbr>s seems to be the central purpose of the paper that Duesberg et al responded to (Chigweder<wbr></wbr>e, 2008), which was to avenue the eliminatio<wbr></wbr>n of those who criticize the HIV-AIDS hypotheses through the conception of a computer model based upon the very assumption<wbr></wbr>s questioned by critics; a model that generated an estimated number of 330,000 unnecessar<wbr></wbr>y AIDS deaths in South Africa, almost 25 times greater than the number of AIDS deaths indicated by the South African Statistics agency.  The paper then implied that government run public health agencies are ‘science authority’<wbr></wbr>, that scientists that disagree or criticize official pronouncem<wbr></wbr>ents of public health agencies should be punished legally while the lead author Pride Chigwedere<wbr></wbr>, as the co-discove<wbr></wbr>rer of the AIDS drug Lamivudine (a nucleoside analogue) that WHO recommends in combinatio<wbr></wbr>n with other toxic drugs as the first-line antiviral therapy treatment regimen in Zimbabwe and other developing nations, has a potential conflict of interest.\r\n\tElsevier appeared to react merely from fear of losing profits, instigated by political blackmail, not from any regard for a fit process of science.  Subsequent<wbr></wbr>ly it convened an anonymous panel to obtain the changes the blackmaile<wbr></wbr>rs wanted, although the panel of 5 reviewers could not conclude that either of the two articles on trial were a “threat to global public health” or were “potential<wbr></wbr>ly libelous” (the originally stated concerns by Elsevier).  Meanwhile no one on the panel, not to mention the blackmaile<wbr></wbr>rs, seems to be aware that the idealistic reputation of peer review has been effectivel<wbr></wbr>y challenged<wbr></wbr>, if not damaged, in recent years.  Richard Smith the editor of the British Medical Journal, for example, noted in 2002 that “Refereein<wbr></wbr>g is expensive, time-consu<wbr></wbr>ming, inaccurate<wbr></wbr>, subject to bias or worse, doesn’t catch errors let alone fraud--and there’s no objective evidence that it works better than the independen<wbr></wbr>t judgment of a qualified editor”.   Indeed hundreds of studies have endeavored to evaluate the effectiven<wbr></wbr>ess of peer review, with no definitive evidence found that it protects integrity, or that it reliably results in better papers being published (The Great Betrayal, Horace Freeland Judson:200<wbr></wbr>4).  Indicative is a review of 135 comparativ<wbr></wbr>e studies by Jefferson et al (JAMA 287, 5 June: 2784-86), presented at the Fourth Internatio<wbr></wbr>nal Congress on Peer Review in 2002 that concluded: “Until such research is undertaken<wbr></wbr>, peer review should be regarded as an untested process with uncertain outcomes”!\r\n" });

They are reinforced (via some form of reward or punishment<wbr></wbr>) to associate a particular sound with a particular effect (i.e., \"bad\" = about to be hit with newspaper, \"good\" = treat coming my way). The word itself has no inherent meaning to the dog, as you could just as easily train it to associate \"bad\" with a reward and \"good\" with a punishment<wbr></wbr>. It is quite a different story if a dog can actually produce different sounds to convey different messages to another member of their species. Of course, this ability might have been learned by the dog at some point in the same way as they \"learned\" the meaning of \"bad\", but the fact that they actually produce the sound, rather than merely respond to it, is what is important here." });

JSReplyMSGId('jst-1', 'jsid-1271888749-773', { "TS": 1271888750, "Text": "The 1988 exchange was only a fledgling first round debate and Science canceled the other rounds after Blattner, Gallo, and Temin lost round 1 so decisively<wbr></wbr>.  Their primary evidence was epidemiolo<wbr></wbr>gical correlatio<wbr></wbr>ns instead of microbiolo<wbr></wbr>gical, and since correlatio<wbr></wbr>ns cannot imply causation, and strong microbiolo<wbr></wbr>gical evidence must be available against HIV prior to it\'s inclusion in the 1985 AIDS definition<wbr></wbr>, the definition<wbr></wbr>\'s required match between the hypothetic<wbr></wbr>al cause HIV and AIDS were artifactua<wbr></wbr>ly generating most of the correlatio<wbr></wbr>ns, so argumenjts of B, G, T looked very weak.  The reason that so much dissent or rethinking exists is because there has still not been a review of the literature that presents strong microbiolo<wbr></wbr>gical evidence against HIV, for example.  So whether it\'s 1988, 1998 or 2010, debate is still justified until that vital evidence is produced because the Emperor still is without clothes.  Also, without that evidence, using the term denialist \'begs the question\' in circular fashion because the very premise that justifies the term (strong evidence exists against HIV) is merely assumed while the term is used to avoid presenting evidence to verify the premise.  So the claim that many people are dead because of AIDS denialism is an additional dimension of begging the question, because again, the evidence that HIV causes AIDS must be produced to make the claim. That\'s what this is all about. Chigwedere et al also beg the question with their computer model, that\'s set up on the very assumption<wbr></wbr>s in question, then the flawed model produces numbers that are being used to reinforce the concept \'denialism<wbr></wbr>\'  and justify imprisonme<wbr></wbr>nt of those who dissent...<wbr></wbr>another tautology.  US National Library of Medicine rejected the petition by the \'complaini<wbr></wbr>ng 18\' to delist Medical Hypotheses because their argument about peer review was spurious.  The phrase you use, \"fanatical zeal to support authority even when that authority exists to extinguish a people\", could just as easily be applied to the AIDS establishm<wbr></wbr>ent if AIDS drugs are really hurting patients instead of helping, which is a point that dissenters make, and therefore crucial to discuss until those that work for the AIDS establishm<wbr></wbr>ent can adequately resolve data descrepanc<wbr></wbr>ies that indicate the drugs harm more than help long term.  Elsevier as owner of course has the right to do what it wants with MH, but it brings into question whether owners of journals should be held to a higher criteria than merely looking at the bottom line, because the history of science strongly suggests that because peer review has many flaws, which include it being used by those of the dominant view, including by knowledge monopolies and research cartels, to hold on to the primary funding sources and hence power.   The fears are understand<wbr></wbr>able, especially as fanned by those in the AIDS establishm<wbr></wbr>ent, but this is supposed to be the process of science, not a religion although the \'complaini<wbr></wbr>ng 18\' seem to be doing there best to force conversion and baptism.

If people stopped assuming they understood and spent more time asking for clarificat<wbr></wbr>ion, the world would be a better place.  \nI applaud the research and am interested in what they find in future research, I just hope the researcher<wbr></wbr>s don\'t let preconcept<wbr></wbr>ions and assumption<wbr></wbr>s about what Aspies or any other group are actually thinking color their interpreta<wbr></wbr>tions." });

By doing this, much sun-light can reflect into the sky, so my method can efficientl<wbr></wbr>y cool the earth.\r\n\r\nThen I have another opinion that we can mosaic zillions of micro-refl<wbr></wbr>ective-mate<wbr></wbr>rial on the roads, streets, motorways or on the many roofs of buildings. By this method, we also can reflect more sun-light out of the earth by the first direct reflection through short wave rather than by the second reflection of surface objection through long wave. One benefit of this method is that it will have no influence on the evaporativ<wbr></wbr>e effect of oceans and another benefit is that it can avoid to be intake by fishes. \r\n" });

JSReplyMSGId('jst-1', 'jsid-1271888769-304', { "TS": 1271888769, "Text": "The theory pertaining to the energy of the expanding universe falling below the energy threshold required for creating matter, just moments after the big bang, seems to be linked to these new finding.  How can time stop in a black hole from the gravitatio<wbr></wbr>nal pull in one spot inversely exceeding the speed of light due to the theory of relativity<wbr></wbr>?  At the very beginings of our universe\'s creation, there was not only all the mass of a previous star condensed into a small space; rather, the entire mass of the entire universe was compacted into a relatively even smaller space in terms of the densities required to contain the matter.  From these assumption<wbr></wbr>s about time slowing to zero once past a certain event horizon, one could conclude that the big bang never made it off the starting block.  the minute all matter in the known universe was created, it simultaneo<wbr></wbr>usly stopped time itself by acting as a \"Black Hole\" and has just sat there ever since.  the phenomena that resulted did no such thing.  if light is unable to escape the grasp of a black hole, representi<wbr></wbr>ng only a tiny fraction of the original mass concentrat<wbr></wbr>ion during the big bang, it leads to only one conclusion<wbr></wbr>.  there is something out there faster than the speed of light. How else would light, energy, mass, and time be able to grow outward through such a brilliantl<wbr></wbr>y enormous in strength concentrat<wbr></wbr>ion of matter? The inverse of this would be rather than something exceeding the speed of light during the big bang, gravitatio<wbr></wbr>nal pull in a black hole does not overcome time, but rather bends it away from the standard observatio<wbr></wbr>n point. using infinite terms in describing black holes is a mathematic<wbr></wbr>al mis-interp<wbr></wbr>retation of a number that is larger than we can easily comprehend<wbr></wbr>.  clearly, if the gravitatio<wbr></wbr>nal pull inside a black hole cannt be larger than the initial value of gravitatio<wbr></wbr>nal pull at the first instants of the big bang, the value of gravity in the black hole cannot be infinite by means of being trumped by the big bang concentrat<wbr></wbr>ion of mass.  mathematic<wbr></wbr>s is what can no longer describe our universe in quantitati<wbr></wbr>ve terms that are accurately applicable to real world physics.  Stopping the passage of time with any amount of matter has already been proven false by the universe growing past the initial stages of the big bang, thus time overcoming all matter in our universe " });

Science at it\'s best.. constantly evolving.. constant new theories and new evidence and new studies. While this theory may or may not pan out (and who knows how much longer it could take to prove one way or the other- if at all?) I love it when a scientist says \"i think i have evidence that goes against a popularly accepted norm- let\'s check it out!\" Science has the ability to always perfect itself- getting better and better all the time. In Science, it\'s okay to be wrong because that means you can do it better! How great is that?! " });

JSReplyMSGId('jst-1', 'jsid-1271888800-52', { "TS": 1271888800, "Text": "Hmmm? Some time about the sixth grade, I learned that there are about thirteen original ideas.  Mr. Atran seems to have made at least for him a startling discovery. We need social scientists to understand the way of terrorists and non-Napole<wbr></wbr>anic war tactics. Who knew!!\r\n\r\nThe notion that the DoD and by implicatio<wbr></wbr>n the rest of the Federal government responsibl<wbr></wbr>e for our security--<wbr></wbr>DHS, NSA, CIA, FBI--has somehow ignored the need for social scientists and psychologi<wbr></wbr>sts in an important much less minor role in the war on terrior is (uh) sophomoric<wbr></wbr>. Why the Subcommitt<wbr></wbr>ee invited this lightweigh<wbr></wbr>t to testify is hard to understand<wbr></wbr>. Oh!  Maybe Jerry Post from George Washington and say George Everly from Johns Hopkins among a host of others already engaged in fighting terror were busy. \r\n\r\nThe service of such profession<wbr></wbr>als continues today. For instance, shortly after 9-11, I was asked by DHS to assemble and manage a 24-7 cadre of academic experts on weapons of mass destructio<wbr></wbr>n.  The objective was to help trouble shoot response and communicat<wbr></wbr>e the nature of an attack and how the response would be carried out, and why, etc. Early on, in consultati<wbr></wbr>on with DHS officials, we concluded that one of if the central issues was to put the human factor up front and center by having social scientists<wbr></wbr>, psychologi<wbr></wbr>sts, and a full array of other discipline<wbr></wbr>s as a major part of our team--thus the reference to Jerry and George. Even so, some knowledge of DARPA, if only their calls for proposal, might lead, even the most unaware, to suspect that human vagueries would be important.\r\n\r\nAs I read deeply into this article, I decided to see who Mr. Scott is. At first, I thought I imagined that an error had been made and that maybe he is an adjunct in the Drama Department<wbr></wbr>. Academics embedded with rifles! Soldier-ps<wbr></wbr>ychologists and sociololog<wbr></wbr>ists--you bet.  So while many US citizens, not just academics, may still rail against the wars, particular<wbr></wbr>ly IRAQ, the military is quite capable of having soldiers with the technical background<wbr></wbr>s, even PhDs and Post doc-level individual<wbr></wbr>s, amongst their ranks.\r\n\r\nAm I angry that our tax dollars are wasted on such pap like this that is camouflage<wbr></wbr>d as expertise." });

We have failed to utilize this magnificen<wbr></wbr>t, elegant, versatile, S A F E spacecraft in more ways than I can list here. We just simply can not abandon the $100 Billion and 30 years of space exploratio<wbr></wbr>n expertise we have invested in the SPACE SHUTTLE. A \"morphed and stretched\"<wbr></wbr>\" SPACE SHUTTLE can take man to geosynchro<wbr></wbr>nous orbit to service and repair hundreds of satellites<wbr></wbr>, serve as the command module for lunar excursions and provide transporta<wbr></wbr>tion for astronauts to Mars and selected moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Restarting<wbr></wbr>, from scratch, a comparable deep space program will set us back another $250 Billion. That is a dollar swing of $350 Billion to drop the SPACE SHUTTLE right now. Write our President and write him before he makes a key address to the Florida space conference on April 15, 2010.

JSReplyMSGId('jst-1', 'jsid-1271888838-982', { "TS": 1271888839, "Text": "I think like many Americans Steve is being \"Americent<wbr></wbr>ric\" in his viewpoint. Other than the Yellow river, most of the lakes you mention are in very dry to extremely dry climates. These areas probably shouldn\'t have any real population<wbr></wbr>s, maybe 300-400 year ago numbers. And...in that regard Steve makes a good point in that population control is the only real answer. \n\nChad and Australia (to use your examples) have climates that have been getting drier and will continue to do so as the climate changes. It all really comes down to how much the regional ecology can support the people living in it. China is ravenous in it\'s consumptio<wbr></wbr>n right now. The Yellow river has several damns and irrigates crops throughout the region. Ironically<wbr></wbr>, these same dams also cause the worst (deadliest<wbr></wbr>) flooding in the world. \n\nWhile some areas need to look at conserving it\'s water for future use (places that rely on lakes/rese<wbr></wbr>rvoirs and have dry environmen<wbr></wbr>ts), and while better irrigation techniques can reduce water loss to the environmen<wbr></wbr>t, making a big hoopla over the water we use to produce corn is \"pushing it\" IMO. \n\nAs a side note, Ft Mac uses a lot of water to produce oil from the sands, and much of this water gets polluted.

First, the fact that wind power can be produced continuous<wbr></wbr>ly doesn\'t mean it can be produced in volumes and at times that are consistent with customer demand.  For that you need storage, which is very expensive.  Second, wind machines produce DC power that has to be passed through an inverter, and that process creates some technical problems that could affect the large existing stock of AC motors.  Third, you\'d need a lot of wind turbines.  Finding an acceptable place (or places) to put them might be problemati<wbr></wbr>c along the eastern seaboard.  Wind power could also be produced in the midwest and moved to the east coast, but that requires transmissi<wbr></wbr>on lines that are equally difficult to site.\n\nBottom line:  like anything else, 100% wind power is possible, but it will be expensive, time-consu<wbr></wbr>ming and require lots of infrastruc<wbr></wbr>ture most folks do not want in their back yards." });

The authors of thei withdrawn article are absolutely free to say whatever they want.  They just can\'t say it in a \"medical\" or \"science\" journal, because it\'s not science, it\'s a political editorial.  \n\nA publicatio<wbr></wbr>n calling itself a \"medical\" or \"science\" journal has a reputation to protect, and it can only do so by limiting its content to articles backed up by data and accepted research protocols.  I think the editor, in this case, confused the popular definition of the word \"hypothesi<wbr></wbr>s\" with the scientific definition<wbr></wbr>, and that was a huge error on his part.  I would have done the same thing if I were Elsevier. The authors of the retracted article are free to find a less scientific forum for their commentary<wbr></wbr>.  For example, the Wall Street Journal or a Dallas newspaper would probably publish it, and the authors stand an excellent chance of landing interviews on Fox news." });

The passenger would be in free fall, so wouldn\'t feel any accelerati<wbr></wbr>on - in fact would feel no different to empty space until tidal forces became significan<wbr></wbr>t at a few thousand km distance (for a stellar mass black hole), and that would feel altogether different from an accelerati<wbr></wbr>on.\r\n\r\nObserver outside wouldn\'t see the ship slow down, they\'d see it accelerate into what would seem like an infinite distance into the black hole, getting progressiv<wbr></wbr>ely more red-shifte<wbr></wbr>d. If the observer could view events on the ship, or the ship\'s clock, THAT would appear to slow down.\r\n\r\nAnd this is a prediction from Einstein\'s theory - I don\'t think he actually \'demonstra<wbr></wbr>ted\' it. He didn\'t put a passenger in a ship and send it into a black hole. That wouldn\'t be ethical. :)\r\n\r\nMatter does take an infinite time to reach the horizon of the existing hole, from the point of view of anyone outside, but it very quickly enters the horizon of the NEW hole ( = old hole + spaceship ), and at that point there\'s no problem in saying that it becomes part of the hole from the point of view of an external observer. Perhaps there are Planck length ambiguitie<wbr></wbr>s here, but I doubt our friends in Ohio have any more idea about that than you or I.\r\n\r\nI wish science journalist<wbr></wbr>s would be honest and state that some scientists have developed a mathematic<wbr></wbr>al methodolog<wbr></wbr>y or model in which black holes cannot form - which is interestin<wbr></wbr>g enough - instead of suggesting they\'ve \"shown\" anything to be the case. These models inevitably have their own assumption<wbr></wbr>s and provisos which may or may not be far-fetche<wbr></wbr>d. It\'s not as if these guys are overturnin<wbr></wbr>g the standard view of black holes at all." });

JSReplyMSGId('jst-1', 'jsid-1271888898-520', { "TS": 1271888898, "Text": "Folks - be careful with reading too much into this. It is certainly a great discovery that multicellu<wbr></wbr>lar organisms are now known which can be anaerobic (this was already known for many unicellula<wbr></wbr>r organisms) - especially since the vastly efficient energy harvesting that comes from being aerobic was thought to give rise to complex multicellu<wbr></wbr>lar life in the first place. So the lifeform gets its energy through other processes, not by respiring oxygen (O2). However - and this is the biggie - it does NOT mean we have knowledge of ANY life that can live without atomic Oxygen (O). Think about it - this anaerobe, all previously known anaerobes, and every other lifeform currently known needs the same basic elements: C H N O P S, because these are critical for the building blocks of life (nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, carbohydra<wbr></wbr>tes). This \"new\" lifeform still uses all those same building blocks and its fundamenta<wbr></wbr>l chemistry is still exactly the same as every other life form. In this short, this is definitely still exactly \"life as we know it\". It would be very misleading to think this, or any other anaerobe, \"lives without oxygen\". Anyway, that wouldn\'t be a problem on other planets... there is enough molecular oxygen to go around the universe, so this should in no way fuel speculatio<wbr></wbr>ns about outer space life. Again, it\'s the \"structure<wbr></wbr>\" of life that is unique on Earth, and all know life, including this new one, follows the same basic structure. If were to find something, for example, that used Silicon instead of Carbon or Sulfur in place of Oxygen, or informatio<wbr></wbr>n storage in something other thand DNA/RNA, or \"proteins\" made out of something other than amino acids, etc... THAT would be something fundamenta<wbr></wbr>lly very different, and has yet to be seen." });

But what if we simplify matters and studies this from a more scientific perspectiv<wbr></wbr>e and say that the person with and without prostheses weigth the same and that we know that the only thing generating force in this case are the thighs (the person with prostheses have no calf muscles and can therefore not run as fast as the healthy person). They both are as equally strong but one thing differs the knee joints. It\'s logical that the spring joint bounces better than the biological joint which mean that more of the force added per step remains longer in the spring. The conclution is that the prosthese person use his energy more efficiant than the biological one. To greatly simplify this think about this as two balls, the balls weigths the same (does not matter in vacuum but anyways) but the other ball is more springy ( the prosthese)<wbr></wbr>. If dropped from the same higth which of them stops bouncing first? The ball which\'s not as springy as the other ball ofcourse! The springier the ball is, the more of its momentum is konserved which leads to lesser force during the impact with the ground which is energy consuming when running. \n\nThe prosthese is not as fast as the biological and therefore should they be accepted in shorter laps where the momentum konsevatio<wbr></wbr>n doesn\'t give any advantage, like 100meters sprint.

For example, I needed to study the interactio<wbr></wbr>n between cells in the bone marrow and a bone tumor.  Because I didn\'t want to hassle of dealing with animals and also because research review boards require it, I looked long and hard for an alternativ<wbr></wbr>e way to study the phenomenon<wbr></wbr>, but eventually got as far as I could with culture models.  I wrote up my attempts to find an alternativ<wbr></wbr>e way of doing the research in my report to the review board.  There\'s simply no way to model a bone marrow environmen<wbr></wbr>t in a tumor bearing animal in a culture dish, and then to examine the effect of a drug requires different routes of administra<wbr></wbr>tion, none of which can be done in vitro.\n\nBelieve me, I wouldn\'t have done the animal research if there was any way I could have gotten around it, and pretty much everyone else felt the same way. It\'s costly, time consuming, and inconvenie<wbr></wbr>nt, but I was able to do research that uncovered a new treatment path for an incurable cancer. Was that a justifiabl<wbr></wbr>e reason?  " });

Newton\'s theories are both valid and wrong at the same time. They have been supplanted and expanded by Einstein and others since. Even if Darwinian Evolution is wrong, or rather incomplete in that it does not adequately explain things and in the future a new theory is formulated that does a better job, it does not matter because that is the future and today Darwinian evolution by process of natural selection is the current foundation<wbr></wbr>al model for all of the biological sciences.

Infinity ruins all physics.  A black hole is not a point in space where gravity grows infinitely strong, it\'s not infinitely massive, nor infinitely small.  It\'s strength of pull on another object is based on both their masses and the distance between them.  What happens if one is floating in space and they are drawn by earth gravitatio<wbr></wbr>nal pull.  They fall toward earth at 9.8m/s2, accelerati<wbr></wbr>ng until reaching terminal velocity.  Same thing would happen in a black hole.  You\'d just fall to the core of it\'s gravity and probably be liquified by the intense heat of friction.  Riddle me this, based on the equation for gravity that gives us 9.8m/s2 here on earth, could there be a black hole with a mass producing a force of gravity of 299,792,45<wbr></wbr>8m/s2, the speed of light? Technicall<wbr></wbr>y, with enough mass and using that equation, yes.  What if it were more than the speed of light?  One law of physics against the other." });

If you are averse to blunt instrument<wbr></wbr>s, don\'t use these kinds of questions in surveys.  I would say they are a necessary evil, however, if you want a wide sample of a large population that isn\'t going to sit still for essay questions. In the full article, Bruer makes the valid point that if the qualifier \"According to the theory of evolution.<wbr></wbr>..\" is inserted before the question, the percentage of \"true\" responses is much higher.  We should consider whether \"scientifi<wbr></wbr>c literacy\" means \" I\'ve heard of this theory, and I know what it means,\" or \"I\'ve heard of this theory, and I believe it to be true.\"  \n\nA big part of the problem is that at one time a survey which showed a large percentage of the population did not believe currently understood scientific theories was taken to be a sign that our educationa<wbr></wbr>l system was deficient, and we were falling behind other countries in a threatenin<wbr></wbr>g world. Today there are prominent people who hold that denial of these theories is perfectly consistent with their alternate beliefs, and so view this as a good thing!   " });

Although evolution is supported by the observatio<wbr></wbr>nal evidence, there are some aspects of molecular biology that don\'t quite fit the evolution theory (at least when it is stated simply).

Tomorrow new data could surface that would cause us to throw out the theor of Evolution -- or gravity or classical thermodyna<wbr></wbr>mics (which is only a subset of quantum thermodyna<wbr></wbr>mics).

JSReplyMSGId('jst-1', 'jsid-1271889058-484', { "TS": 1271889058, "Text": "I second this. The general formula of popular science journalism seems to be: Find something that could suggest something earth-shat<wbr></wbr>tering; Find some other scientist with half a brain (a whole is too much, none is too little) and ask them what they think; report as if both ideas have even-level credibilit<wbr></wbr>y.\n\nNew math that works pops up all the time, it doesn\'t mean it is so. When it comes to theoretica<wbr></wbr>l physics, which is any kind of physics we can\'t directly observe, it is all about what theory makes the most accurate prediction<wbr></wbr>s with the least complexity<wbr></wbr>. In that order.\n\nA complex theory that makes even the smallest improvemen<wbr></wbr>t to prediction<wbr></wbr>s is the new working model. One that can be made more simple but retain the same level of predictive quality, is the new working model.\n\nThe reason that we think of time as fluid is that we are, ourselves, observers. And the math must take that into account and the easiest way to do that is to assume time is fluid. This doesn\'t mean it is. It just means that the math is more simple if it is. Since it makes the same quality prediction<wbr></wbr>s as the HORRIFICAL<wbr></wbr>LY complex alternativ<wbr></wbr>e theories you need to make time progressio<wbr></wbr>n constant, it is the preferred working model.\n\nIt isn\'t perfect. For example, the 3 body problem. But it does a better job of predicting things like the orbit of Mercury and how much light will bend around the sun than did the model before it.\n\nSo, what about this new idea with black holes makes better prediction<wbr></wbr>s? Well, assuming all else is even, it fits with how we have always presumed the universe to work. Which is that informatio<wbr></wbr>n, and I mean here the physics concept of informatio<wbr></wbr>n, can\'t be destroyed. Because if you could make informatio<wbr></wbr>n vanish, our history would vanish. We would not be able to trust any observatio<wbr></wbr>ns, nor even our memories. Black holes have long been thought to break this flow of informatio<wbr></wbr>n. There are a few ways to sort of avoid it, such as Hawking\'s idea that black holes infuse other universes with that informatio<wbr></wbr>n, and I guess presumably it could one day enter another black hole and re-enter ours? Not sure how that works. There is also the idea that when a black hole would evaporate the caught informatio<wbr></wbr>n would be released. However, if this theory suggests another way to have all the effects of a black hole without the loss of informatio<wbr></wbr>n, then perhaps it is a better model.\n\nWe wouldn\'t know until we could make observatio<wbr></wbr>ns of it. Actually, we may never know, because if black holes make informatio<wbr></wbr>n vanish, we can\'t really trust what we think we know about them, even when observed." });

They can reconcile this with their intellectu<wbr></wbr>ally lazy notion of \"God did it\" even though it is a bit of a mental brain fart, but still, the two can work in tandem. Even the complex model of evolution can be linked to the intellectu<wbr></wbr>ally lazy notion of \"God did it\" although not nearly as simply. In the end, I actually think it is high time we relegate religion to the dustbin of society. It is time that America grows up and joins the “civilized<wbr></wbr>” world and realizes it’s potential. Please, before it is too late and we regress back to stone age times because of stone age minds." });

Faith can not be imposed upon others. Imposed faith is its negation. Therefore, freedom comes first in our human condition and while we accept that your fellows can disagree with your opinion they must have to show a great respect to your opinion.\nI hope they will find in their hearts the very same God that will continue to inspire your life." });

Studies done on about five hundred sets of identical twins from WW II veterans show that AD is definitely not a directly inherited disease, as it requires a toxic insult.   Certainly, all the informatio<wbr></wbr>n and scientific studies point to toxin(s) as the major cause of AD and mercury is the likely culprit.  Mercury is highly neurotoxic<wbr></wbr>. Mercury is in all probabilit<wbr></wbr>y the major factor, but certainly not the only factor, in causing  many neurologic<wbr></wbr>al disorders and in particular Alzheimer\'<wbr></wbr>s.  This is explained in detail in the Petition to Reconsider filed with the FDA requesting that mercury be banned as a filling material.

Mercury/si<wbr></wbr>lver fillings are by far the largest source of mercury, much more so then fish.

JSReplyMSGId('jst-1', 'jsid-1271889149-660', { "TS": 1271889149, "Text": "The real question is what is the cause of AD, before looking for \"the mechanism of action\" of any treatment.  Studies done on about five hundred sets of identical twins from WW II veterans show that AD is definitely not a directly inherited disease, as it requires a toxic insult.   Certainly, all the informatio<wbr></wbr>n and scientific studies point to toxin(s) as the major cause of AD and mercury is the likely culprit.  Mercury is highly neurotoxic<wbr></wbr>. Mercury is in all probabilit<wbr></wbr>y the major factor, but certainly not the only factor, in causing  many neurologic<wbr></wbr>al disorders and in particular Alzheimer\'<wbr></wbr>s.  This is explained in detail with references in the Petition to Reconsider filed with the FDA requesting that mercury be banned as a filling material. Go to \nwww.iaomt.<wbr></wbr>org/article<wbr></wbr>s/files/fil<wbr></wbr>es314/petit<wbr></wbr>ion%20for%2<wbr></wbr>0reconsider<wbr></wbr>ation%20090<wbr></wbr>309.pdf    beginning at page 24 for the science to support the connection between mercury and AD.  Mercury/si<wbr></wbr>lver fillings are by far the largest source of mercury, much more so then fish.  Go to the Petition at pp 4 -23 and in particular pp. 11-12 for the science re mercury exposure from \"silver\" fillings.  " });

Indeed, the statement \"We\'d go from \'we don\'t really know how the big bang started\' to \'we don\'t really know how this wormhole started\'. We\'d also go from \'dark matter expands the universe\' to \'wormhole end points expand the universe\'\" simply means that we have one more alternativ<wbr></wbr>e theory explaining the beginning of our universe.

It seems to me that scientists who accept the possibilit<wbr></wbr>y of such \'gentle\' interferen<wbr></wbr>ce in evolution should be considered acceptable in evolutiona<wbr></wbr>ry research,  on the same grounds that scientists who believe in the power of prayer are not generally considered  unacceptab<wbr></wbr>le   in fields such as physics and engineerin<wbr></wbr>g,  Miraculous divine interferen<wbr></wbr>ce in evolution seems to me no more unacceptab<wbr></wbr>le than divine interferen<wbr></wbr>ce in the operation of Newton\'s laws." });

JSReplyMSGId('jst-1', 'jsid-1271889220-742', { "TS": 1271889220, "Text": "\"The universe began with a big explosion\" is a terrible statement for the scientific<wbr></wbr>ally literate, as far as I am concerned.  Do I agree with the Big Bang theory?  Well, I\'d say it\'s the best theory available that fits the evidence, but would I say it was necessaril<wbr></wbr>y a big explosion, like somebody set off a bunch of firecracke<wbr></wbr>rs?  Eh, not so much.  The \"explosion<wbr></wbr>\" was a literal outward progressio<wbr></wbr>n of matter from an originally highly-con<wbr></wbr>densed state, but I can see where one might consider that differentl<wbr></wbr>y from an \"explosion<wbr></wbr>\" of bomb variety.\r\n\r\nThat being said, there\'s really no excuse on the evolution front.  The fundamenta<wbr></wbr>ls of science make it clear what constitute<wbr></wbr>s a valid hypothesis<wbr></wbr>, and there\'s no experiment<wbr></wbr>al (much less rigorously examined and reproducib<wbr></wbr>le) evidence for \"Intellige<wbr></wbr>nt Design\"/Cr<wbr></wbr>eationism.  If you want to believe something or someone set off the Big Bang, well, nobody can disprove you, but it\'s pretty clear that humanity has physically changed over the past six thousand years alone, much less over the time span before that.  Disagreein<wbr></wbr>g that humanity has been around for more than six thousand years indicates a lack of scientific literacy as well, given the dating methods we have available.

(Clearly there was nothing nice there, just sounds like you’re bitter at something and taking it out on the article lol)\r\n\r\nSecond of all, that comment that you made was quite ignorant, arrogant, and frankly to put it bluntly stupid.  Maybe you should read the article closely before you put yourself out there to be ridiculed.<wbr></wbr>.. it clearly stated in the article that this wasn\'t at all a conclusive experiment<wbr></wbr>.  It\'s just giving you insight.

Is it really necessary for you to have to cram negativity down other people throats?  Like the saying goes “You learn something new every single day.”  I say take the informatio<wbr></wbr>n as it comes and once you’ve gotten ALL your informatio<wbr></wbr>n then you would have the means to draw your own conclusion<wbr></wbr>s in your mind.  Don’t just take one article and completely “write off” the idea that’s exactly what a closed minded and insensible person would do.  All I hope for is that you’re not a teacher because there would be some unknowledg<wbr></wbr>eable children out there.  Jan Peregrinus just take this comment as… “maybe I should keep my mind open to new knowledge and see what the world has to offer”  seriously you live once and life is to short to have ignorance and arrogance. {^_~}  {^_^} I just wish people can open their eyes to the possibilit<wbr></wbr>ies that the world and our universe has to offer." });

Not much has changed in the thinking of the church during the past 400 years.  Just another example of priestly classes attempting to control what is considered truth in the minds of the dumb masses.\n\n**********<wbr></wbr>**********\n\nThe Galileo affair was a sequence of events, beginning around 1610, during which Galileo Galilei came into conflict with the Catholic Church over his support of Copernican astronomy.<wbr></wbr>[1]\n\nIn 1610, Galileo published his Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger)<wbr></wbr>, describing the surprising observatio<wbr></wbr>ns that he had made with the new telescope. These and other discoverie<wbr></wbr>s exposed major difficulti<wbr></wbr>es with the understand<wbr></wbr>ing of the heavens that had been held since antiquity, and raised new interest in radical teachings such as the heliocentr<wbr></wbr>ic theory of Copernicus (published in De revolution<wbr></wbr>ibus orbium coelestium in 1543).\n\nIn reaction, many scholars attacked the theory because it seemingly contradict<wbr></wbr>ed several passages of Scripture. Galileo\'s part in the controvers<wbr></wbr>ies over theology, astronomy, and philosophy culminated in his trial and sentencing in 1633 on a grave suspicion of heresy." });

Many black hole\'s in our universe would potentiall<wbr></wbr>y have other \"baby\" universe\'s at their singularit<wbr></wbr>y points, and so on. It would be evolution on the grandest of scales, as universes seed themselves with stars with the ability to propagate more universe\'s<wbr></wbr>, constantly refining themselves toward the right state of elements and conditions for this to occur.

If we want to mention big bangs, we should include the other big bangs that continue to happen in space, even as we speak, and those that have occurred long ago. We should consider the other big bangs or planetary collision that have occurred before the so-called ultimate big bang that scientist have theorized. There is also an infinite number of universes out there in space. And they were not created either; they were just there. We do not have the capacity to comprehend the dimension that could be used to accurately describe their existence. So, we should indeed leave it that. We will never know or understand everything<wbr></wbr>, we can only do our best to understand our world. In fact, we have done pretty well with our limited resources of science and mathematic<wbr></wbr>s." });

Any real Life Scientist  knows who Einstein was referring to. Time and new discoverie<wbr></wbr>s  has possibly  proved Einstein wrong because total in math is a limit and the 18% remaining  is very near a total. Remember AAAS,NFS, and NSF have been in charge of  science for 150 years promoting Darwin\'s Tree as Life Science or actually as a cult religion . They even created microevolu<wbr></wbr>tion and macroevolu<wbr></wbr>tion so evolve could be used to avoid giving a reason for their existance other than it was an accident. I am not using the very strong term stupid but will leave that up to Einstein, and  the following great scientists among many other scientific creationis<wbr></wbr>ts believed in Intelligen<wbr></wbr>t Design.

Virtually all surveys (like the Pew Forum) who question people under 30 about their religious conviction<wbr></wbr>s, find that the biggest losers are the evangelica<wbr></wbr>ls and mainstream protestant groups alike.  Moreover, the one group that is truly growing by leaps and bounds are not evangelica<wbr></wbr>ls, as you chose to believe, or even Christians as a whole, but those who lack any strong bond with religion whatsoever<wbr></wbr>.  It seems your Evangelism<wbr></wbr>, rather than spreading the Gospel, is driving people away from the faith altogether<wbr></wbr>, and doing it with gusto.  I am glad to hear that in your provincial neck of the woods your faith is doing blockbuste<wbr></wbr>r business, but all national polls really indicate that modern Christian Evangelism is the best tool the Devil ever created for destroying faith in Jesus.  You and the current cadre of evangelica<wbr></wbr>ls may be able to continuall<wbr></wbr>y deny obvious scientific facts for the remainder of your lives without much consequenc<wbr></wbr>e, but young people are voting with their feet -- they are clearly not buying your brand of faith anymore -- and this result I am sure will weigh heavily against you come the day of your own Judgment.  But, by all means, feel free to continue claiming that black is white, as you do in your post here and as you do within your own sense of faith, because your arrogant and obstinate attitude continuall<wbr></wbr>y proves to those of us, who have long prayed for the demise of Christian Evangelism<wbr></wbr>, that we are indeed having our prayers answered with every passing day.

But we\'re still not talking about the same thing, I fear, so let me try a different approach.\n\nIn Chapter 7 of the Science and Engineerin<wbr></wbr>g Indicators 2008 (<wbr></wbr>http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind08/front/about.htm): \"Scientifi<wbr></wbr>c literacy is the capacity to use scientific knowledge, to identify questions and to draw evidence-b<wbr></wbr>ased conclusion<wbr></wbr>s in order to understand and help make decisions about the natural world and the changes made to it through human activity.\"\n\nI maintain a person can do the above without *accepting<wbr></wbr>* the theory or denouncing all others. I\'m not saying this is common, but neverthele<wbr></wbr>ss I see no reason why a person couldn\'t be a proponent of Creation, and yet have formal mastery of the principles of Evolution. Such a person would have the ability to use scientific knowledge to draw evidence based conclusion<wbr></wbr>s about Evolution, and yet for whatever reason may decide to make decisions about the natural world based on Creation.\n\nOr using your question of gravity as an example:\n\n\"Gravity is the result of the warping of space-time by mass where bodies follow the shortest path as dictated by this curvature.<wbr></wbr>\" What about \"gravity is a force mediated by a massless (and hypothetic<wbr></wbr>al!) elementary particle with spin-2?\"  Does your question about relativity require me to categorica<wbr></wbr>lly denounce the existence of a graviton? If it does then maybe I\'ll answer \"no\" because (as far as I know, and admittedly I don\'t know much) this is still an open question. Oh wait, was the intent of your question simply to confirm I knew relativity is one theory about gravity? Then say so: \"General relativity explains gravity as the result of the warping of space-time<wbr></wbr>...\" and I\'ll answer \"yes\".\n\n" });

Too many rooms that\'s not a part of the original foundation<wbr></wbr>. The network ought to be simple. Electromag<wbr></wbr>netism and the week nuclear force has already been unified. Dark energy is an aspect of space/time with  0 energy. How? IT is not an energy.  It\'s an aspect. Now you will have to redo your math. Now, dark matter,on the other hand, for it to exist, it would have to have some kind of buoyancy pressure to keep it from collecting in massive solids. Since the earth still weights the same, dark energy has not collapsed. Now, if buoyant (as many believe and HST has taken pictures of  vast hydrogen clouds connecting galaxies \"proving\" dark matter) it just would not work. Imagine you tunneling through earth. the deeper you go, the lighter you get. That is because the deeper you go, you have more earth all around you instead of under you. This action could not keep a galaxy together. I Believe dark matter can be explained away with 3 points. (1)...the mass of super massive black holes have been seriously under estimated. The observed rotation curve at the outer edge of the galaxy can be explained by a \"beefed up\" super massive black hole.  The center rotation curve can also be explained as space/time is being dragged around. That is,from our vantage point,we see stars near the center going slower than they are from there own vantage point thus matching the rotational curve of the outer rim. This time dilation makes it difficult to weight mass especially if you omit it. (2)...Ever<wbr></wbr>y globular cluster has an intermedia<wbr></wbr>te mass black hole. Also, stellar mass black holes are probably more common than thought, Our galaxy is at least 8 billion yrs old, A lot of star evolution for massive stars, think about it. If a stellar mass black was not \"feeding\" or part of a binary system, it would go undetected<wbr></wbr>. Now in (2) we have most but not all of the mass we need. (1) we have a little relativity and extra mass, now (3) Gravity propagates at the speed of light. If the sun would disappear altogether<wbr></wbr>, it would take about 8 min.before we see it disappear and at the same moment earth would stray from it\'s orbit. Now, with that in mind, consider a star say 30,000 Lt yrs away in the arm preceding the sun around the galaxy. The sun is now  feeling the gravity of that star at a point where it was 30,000 yrs ago.The star is not there now. It has moved farther around the galaxy during that time with a weaker pull of gravity following the inverse square law.  In other words, each star in an arm of a galaxy feels a \"phantom\" pull of the preceding star more than giving the preceding star a gravitatio<wbr></wbr>nal drag. This effect is small but should not be omitted. Pennies makes dollars. Now, why do we need worm holes to explain dark energy and dark matter? Calculus can not tell you what happens inside a black hole or a worm hole (or if it exist) because it is based on theory. Respectful<wbr></wbr>ly, I think we should consider what went over our heads first before adding more rooms to the house than we need. By the way, If the Higgs Boson is discovered<wbr></wbr>, it might be found to give mass to quarks via gravatons which might be indistingu<wbr></wbr>ishable from the strong nuclear force at higher energies.\nI am not a scientist,<wbr></wbr>but this makes since to me. I have the up most respect for all you guys out there.You might even be right." });

Keep at it boys you may \"get it\" someday. What doesn\'t make any sense is the big bang theory. It proposes to explain the origin of the universe by positing a preexistin<wbr></wbr>g \"singulari<wbr></wbr>ty\", itself a prepostero<wbr></wbr>us notion. Surely, you have to ask where did this supposed singularit<wbr></wbr>y come from. In fact, if you keep asking where did that come from, you eventually arrive at an act of creation by something that always existed. Call it what you want, eventually all those cryptic mathematic<wbr></wbr>al notations come to naught. Also, as I understand the concept of the \"scientifi<wbr></wbr>c method\" the \"Big Bang Theory\" should be called the \"Big Band Hypothesis<wbr></wbr>\" because there is no way to test it empiricall<wbr></wbr>y with some human devised experiment<wbr></wbr>. Same goes for the \"Theory of Evolution\" which should be called \"Darwin\'s Hypothesis<wbr></wbr>\" or something similar. No one has yet devised an experiment to test any of it\'s tenets that has ever yielded fruitage. Everything observed in nature is really only evidence that most , if not all, species have within them the ability to adapt to new circumstan<wbr></wbr>ces which may result in them looking a little different." });

Perhaps before the creation of the universe all was pure energy which in some unknown way for unknown reasons started to knit itself into subatomic particles which then formed atoms and molecules in a high energy plasma and on up the hierarchy to you and me. The first matter need not have exploded into empty space.  It could as easily have stared simply, pop, and with growing purpose organized outward from there like an ice crystal growing in a pond until all is solid.  It may have commenced universall<wbr></wbr>y; not at a single point, Let There be Light style, the ancient’s only metaphor for energy particles. The creation process is said to be accelerati<wbr></wbr>ng outward but a better word would be snowballin<wbr></wbr>g and 3D, assembling outward faster and faster, or so it appears from our point our view.  As for time, once there is matter there is gravity and the clock starts running, in that we can look backwards through history, geological time, and even to light traveling since the beginning to give us a sense of the passage of time.  But it is really no more than the history of creation, an illusion, not its present state.  Now. That changes continuall<wbr></wbr>y although tomorrow never comes.  " });

And to say our universe comes from another universe, well, that\'s something of a cop out, because isn\'t the universe supposed to encompass everything<wbr></wbr>?\r\nNow, you don\'t have to let go of it yet, because evidently the Big Bang theory still has plenty of legs on it.  It\'s the most comprehens<wbr></wbr>ive  (though far from complete) explanatio<wbr></wbr>n they\'ve come up with so far (oh excuse me except for the explanatio<wbr></wbr>n involving the giant bearded man in the white robe who lives in the sky and declared everything into existence) and is stimulatin<wbr></wbr>g additional thinking.

It\'s probably obvious that I am not a profession<wbr></wbr>al scientist, but here\'s what I think:  the Big Bang is like the concept of a Point in geometry.  It doesn\'t really exist, but by postulatin<wbr></wbr>g that it does exist, we\'ve come up with a lot of useful ideas that help to explain and measure reality.  So keep at it, but don\'t get to enamored of it, because eventually that theory is going down!" });

The origin of the big-bang needs an explanatio<wbr></wbr>n, as does the destinatio<wbr></wbr>n of everything that disappears into a black hole.\n\nIf instead of a star, the singularit<wbr></wbr>y in the source universe was in the centre of a supermassi<wbr></wbr>ve galaxy that fell into itself after consuming enough material and energy to populate our current universe, this could work.\n\nIn this way a \"many universes\" model would work, with universes bubbling out of eachother at various points, then collapsing again and reforming. Our universe is a lucky result of many, many bubbles that have formed and then dissolved. This seems to fit the same dispersion of state we evidence in our own universe. \n\nAs we get ever smaller, we have seen no bottom to matter; perhaps one day we will see small enough not only for strings but yet more fundamenta<wbr></wbr>l components<wbr></wbr>. Why should it not be that when we look ever larger, there is also no limit." });

In this case, consider the bombardier beetle. It manufactur<wbr></wbr>es two chemicals within its body that explode on contact. It uses these chemicals to spray boiling hot liquid on anything that may attack it with spray nozzles that it can point in almost any direction. Why doesn\'t the beetle explode itself when these chemicals mix? Why doesn\'t the beetle get burned by the boiling hot liquid? Everything about the bombardier flies in the face of Darwin\'s hypothesis<wbr></wbr>. Every part of the bombardier beetle used in this deadly defense mechanism including its explosion proff mixing chamber and its heat resistant makeup HAD to come together all at once. Otherwise the beetle would have blown himself up the first time it mixed those chemicals. Not very likely to get itself very far along an \"evolution<wbr></wbr>ary\" path if it blows up every time a predator attacks. What do you suppose the odds of all those parts evolving at once are? One scientist who studies those beetles figured the odds were astronomic<wbr></wbr>al against it. He went from being a Darwinist to a creationis<wbr></wbr>t as his studies of the Bombardier continued. The Bible says that the evidence of the creator are within the things created. The house you build to live in is evidence of a builder. Things simply do not happen by themselves<wbr></wbr>. Otherwise we would be fond of saying things like \"Isn\'t it wonderful that that car just created itself out of nothing just in time for you to start using it?\"" });

Your quote of \"theories can incorporat<wbr></wbr>e facts and laws and tested hypotheses<wbr></wbr>\" mentions only tested hypothesis<wbr></wbr>. Without at least one tested hypothesis you do not have a theory. Darwin\'s hypothesis attempts to extrapolat<wbr></wbr>e observatio<wbr></wbr>ns of the natural world as we see it today all the way back in time to the point where there was no life in a world that no one has ever seen much less left a record of. People have attempted and failed to recreate this so called primordial soup condition and attempted to coax life from lifelessne<wbr></wbr>ss using all kinds of external stimuli that were seen as plausible to exist. This is the basic brick in the hypothesis<wbr></wbr>, and until you can devise an experiment to show reliably and repeatedly by any research facility that life can be caused to occur from lifelessne<wbr></wbr>ss in some probable scenario, then all you have is a untested hypotheses<wbr></wbr>. Also, to counter your claim that gravity is a theory, I say that gravity is a natural condition that exists whether you understand it or not. If there was a valid theory of gravity then you should be able to manipulate it. Let us all know when you have come up with an anti-gravi<wbr></wbr>ty device. It will make you rich beyond the wildest dreams of avarice. By the way, I am a practicing Electronic<wbr></wbr>s Engineer so I have a pretty good grasp of things that would have been called \"magic\" only a couple of decades ago. The following link describes the scientific method. Among other things it supports my contention that a tested (proven true) hypothesis precedes an idea being advanced to the status of being a theory. http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_scientific_method.shtml\n\n\n" });

JSReplyMSGId('jst-1', 'jsid-1271889484-545', { "TS": 1271889484, "Text": "Is it possible for a universe to be at the center of a black hole?\n\nA black hole is not a hole at all.  It’s relatively spherical.  A sphere that is 3,000 times the mass of our sun but only 10 times the diameter sits at the center of our Milky Way galaxy.  It powers the galaxy the way our sun powers our solar system, just on a much larger scale.  When I began to think of a Black Hole as a sphere and not some kind of drain that matter falls into, I started to see things differentl<wbr></wbr>y.  Matter was pulled into the center of a sphere, from all directions at once.  The singularit<wbr></wbr>y could be thought of as the core of the black hole.  \n\nI began to think of a black hole as a type of star.  What happens to a super massive star?  It’s life ends because gravity wins out.  The core collapses into a black hole.  Black holes grow by consuming gas and dust.  They also grow by  merging with other black holes.  It would make sense then to believe the core of the black hole would also grow.  What would happen to the black hole when and if gravity wins?  What would happen if the core of the black hole collapsed?  \n\nIs it possible that the energy released when the core of a black hole collapses ignites the birth of a new universe?  And that universe exists inside the mother black hole which itself exists in it’s own universe.  When the core collapses a big bang occurs.  A massive sun is destroyed after a supernova.  I believe a black hole survives its supernova.  The new universe will exist and expand from within the mother black hole.  I believe that energy from the baby universe radiates back into the mother universe by means of Hawking radiation.  Hawking radiation might even answer the question of the expanding universe.  Our universe is expanding at an ever increasing rate.  Hawking radiation may be pulling our universe apart.  \n\nA growing singularit<wbr></wbr>y within a super massive black hole seems to me very similar to the descriptio<wbr></wbr>n of the first moments of our universe.  A perfect medium of infinite mass.  Matter stripped down to it’s most basic elements.  I believe these are one and the same. \n\nAt the instant the core collapses a big bang occurs.  The explosion instantly creates a bubble within the mother black hole.  This bubble could be Guth’s inflationa<wbr></wbr>ry theory.   \n\nDark matter may be the outer regions of the mother black hole that completely surrounds the baby universe.  A shell of black hole would have a powerful gravitatio<wbr></wbr>nal pull of its own pulling the baby universe apart.  The baby universe grows within the mother black hole until it has matured and eventually dies.\n\nDark energy may be the current created by Hawking radiation leaking back into the mother universe.  A universe dying and a black hole evaporatin<wbr></wbr>g back into space are the same thing, I believe. \n" });

Or is it more likely our purpose is to achieve a complete understand<wbr></wbr>ing of how everything in the universe works?\r\n\r\nClearly I would choose the latter if I can. Once again, I would like to emphasize that, I chose that because I THINK we human being should trace our origin or we will just be the same as those wild animals and I don\'t want to be like that. This is only my choice. I am not saying that I am right. Of course we can also simply ignore those physical laws lying beyond our world and make a good living. But here comes the question which always annoys me. What is the meaning of surviving peacefully on this small planet? What is the meaning of such existence of ecosystem where we human beings exist? What is the meaning of continuing our species as long as we can though we will finally die when our Sun becomes a red giant which is expected to engulf our planet as expected by our knowledge of stars? When I think of these questions, I don\'t think making our living on this planet safely and peacefully has any meaning. That\'s why I chose the latter. (Though I admit that we NEED those people who care only our planet since without them, I probably can\'t live well.)\r\n\r\nIndeed, what do you mean by the simplest solution? Do you think that managing our planet is simpler than pursuiting the truth? Somebody may find it easier to deal with physics and mathematic<wbr></wbr>s than deal with people in the society. Somebody may find it easier to be a scientist than be a politician<wbr></wbr>. There is no criteria about what is simple and what is not, I think." });

The nebular theory is and was stupid to begin with and they still teach it like it was religious dogma. The Sun has almost all the mass in our solar system. The planets have almost all the angular momentum and they are divided into distinct different groups. That does not happen by a slow congealing of a uniform gas evenly over time.

This theory doesn\'t imply compressed stars or matter, but implies a fluctuatio<wbr></wbr>n of the false void onto or into Higgs\' Fields. The fluctuatio<wbr></wbr>n produced a high energy density field by quantum tunneling (already observed many times; read http://www.scienceonline.org/cgi/content/full/299/5608/867) that has nothing to do with collapsed stars. On the other hand, the teleologic<wbr></wbr>al explanatio<wbr></wbr>n, like that found in petpetpet\'<wbr></wbr>s post and others\' posts, is the quite inappropri<wbr></wbr>ate for trying to elucidate the origin of the universe. Not even philosophy admits the teleologic<wbr></wbr>al explanatio<wbr></wbr>n. It’s the same that happens with creationis<wbr></wbr>t assertions<wbr></wbr>, if the universe, for being complex, had to be created by someone or something because nothing with such complexity can appear from nothing, then intrinsica<wbr></wbr>lly that someone or something had forcibly to have been created by someone or something more complex… and etcetera. Concluding<wbr></wbr>, this theory doesn’t contemplat<wbr></wbr>e blackholes created from collapsed stars, but by fluctuatio<wbr></wbr>ns of the false void which exerts a negative pressure over matter and energy. These are real systems which can be checked out in any suitable particle accelerato<wbr></wbr>r (cyclotron<wbr></wbr>). The same process we apply in a cyclotron took place 13.8 billion years ago in a region of space in a mother-uni<wbr></wbr>verse. Regarding the origin of the first mother-uni<wbr></wbr>verse, I only am allowed to tell you that the space and time are not “things” created from nothingnes<wbr></wbr>s." });

This is called the singularit<wbr></wbr>y. This theory avoids this problem by placing the particles at different locations and different speed in the Big Bang moment. This is a good thing, but ....\n\nOne can interpret the theory that our universe is inside a black hole in a much larger universe, but also in a completely different place and in a larger scale. It seems strange to place the universe \"inside\" a wormhole, because there are not even made a reliable theoretica<wbr></wbr>l model of wormhole that can stay connected for 1 second without a kind form of \"exotic matter\"! How can one explain how the size of the electromag<wbr></wbr>netic forces are formed in relation to the gravity of the new universe? Instead of explaining the singularit<wbr></wbr>y of the Big Bang, the singularit<wbr></wbr>y is moved to another universe!\n\nIt\'s actually a new understand<wbr></wbr>ing of wormholes in this theory and when I think it is illogical to mix black holes into it. I see either wormhole in this context that a one-way bridge between two universes, where the entrance is the edge of the universe A and end the center of universe B. It would certainly create a balance and a regular renewal." });

Let us put an end to fissile materials, period.\n\t\nAll it will take is a little support politicall<wbr></wbr>y and financiall<wbr></wbr>y.\n\nWe have the technology<wbr></wbr>, it is currently known technology<wbr></wbr>! Developed in the 1950\'s and \"dropped\" on the world in a BIG way back then. It was refined by our National Labs to be done in a small way in the 1970\'s. Scientists said to congressio<wbr></wbr>nal committees \"that it was the only way to go\" and and that there were \"no show stoppers\" but it went dormant from lack of funding. In the 1990\'s it was vetted by the scientific community in Germany, but never built due to lack of funding. It is being studied in Russia and Germany today and maybe China, but the US is silent still. It is big, no, BIG.  It produces 35GWe, bigger than utility companies have wanted to deal with, they have wanted 1.5GWe plants. Well, this can not be done that size and be economical<wbr></wbr>.\n\nThis is not laser fusion, not cold fusion, nor magnetic confinemen<wbr></wbr>t fusion ... all needing a magic material and are decades away from production<wbr></wbr>, if then. It can be a base load electrical supplier, not like wind, or solar. It is large but should not impact the food supplies as would bio fuels. It does not generate carbon emissions nor highly radio-acti<wbr></wbr>ve wastes.\n\nThis is the \"Silver Bullet\" the President and the world is looking for in energy generation<wbr></wbr>. It is environmen<wbr></wbr>tally sustainabl<wbr></wbr>e and represents a major opportunit<wbr></wbr>y for businesses<wbr></wbr>. It provides national energy security ... and that is not just political rhetoric!\n\nIt can cost less per kWh than fossil fuel generation<wbr></wbr>.\n\nVisit www.fusion<wbr></wbr>powercorpor<wbr></wbr>ation.com to get a basic education.\n\nLet us do this ASAP for \"Mother Earth\" our home. \nI am interested in your thoughts after you have explored the URL.\n\nHal\nhhelsley@w<wbr></wbr>ildblue.net\n\nnote: nuclear energy has two parts: Fission (with radio-acti<wbr></wbr>ve waste problems) and Fusion (it is BIG)\n\n\nTwelve Fascinatin<wbr></wbr>g Little Known \nFacts about the Use of Fusion Energy \nto Generate Electricit<wbr></wbr>y  \n  … the “Holy Grail” of clean green energy supplies. \n\n 1.  Fusion has no carbon emissions.  It is CLEAN - GREEN energy. It is not a finite fossil fuel. \n 2.  Fusion electricit<wbr></wbr>y can cost less per kW than Coal. \n 3.  Fusion’s fuel supply is virtually unlimited. \n 4.  Fusion energy can be harnessed in ways that create little or NO highly radioactiv<wbr></wbr>e waste. \n 5.  Fusion energy developmen<wbr></wbr>t will create a new industry. \n 6.  Fusion energy developmen<wbr></wbr>t will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. \n 7.  Fusion energy developmen<wbr></wbr>t can restore America’s position of world leadership<wbr></wbr>. \n 8.  Fusion energy sources can provide the nation with real energy security … not just political rhetoric. \n 9.  Fusion energy is supportive of nonprolife<wbr></wbr>ration. \n10. Use of Fusion energy can improve the global standard of living and the quality of life. \n11. Fusion energy generation can fuel the nation’s and the world’s economic recovery. \n12. Fusion power generation can use currently known technology - all vetted in the 1990’s and be on line by 2020. \n\nBonus Facts -                  \nFusion energy does not cost too much.            \nEnergy paradigms take 30/40 years to change, that folks is 2050! \nWe must start now to meet the world’s future energy needs.      \n" });

JSReplyMSGId('jst-1', 'jsid-1271889564-59', { "TS": 1271889564, "Text": "It\'s about time. Here\'s an example of Duesberg (along with co-authors Claus Koehnlein and David Rasnick) deliberate<wbr></wbr>ly misquoting an NEJM paper in an article they published in 2003:\n\nhttp://www.duesberg.com/papers/chemical-bases.html\n\n\"the evidence for \'declining morbidity and mortality\' is only based on uncontroll<wbr></wbr>ed survey studies that investigat<wbr></wbr>ed how long HIV-positi<wbr></wbr>ve, clinically healthy subjects, but mostly from AIDS risk groups, survived on various anti-HIV drugs. The largest and most influentia<wbr></wbr>l of these surveys was conducted by Palella et al (1998) who investigat<wbr></wbr>ed in 1998 1255 anti-HIV drug-treat<wbr></wbr>ed \'patients, each of which had at least one CD4+ count below 100\' from nine clinics in the US. However, all of these \'patients\' were \'nonhospit<wbr></wbr>alized\', AIDS-free subjects. \'Patients with a diagnosis of cytomegalo<wbr></wbr>virus retinitis or M. aviarum complex disease before study entry or during the first 30 days of follow-up and patients with active P. carinii pneumonia at the beginning of follow-up were excluded.\' A similar survey investigat<wbr></wbr>ed in 2001 1219 anti-HIV drug-treat<wbr></wbr>ed Canadian HIV-positi<wbr></wbr>ves with less than 200 CD4+ cells, of which 87% were AIDS-free (Hogg et al 2001). Neither of these studies mentions drug-free controls.\"\n\nThe NEJM paper by Frank Pallela that is being misquoted focused on people with advanced illness (less than 100 CD4 T cells). The full text is available online: http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/338/13/853\n\nThe data shows the highest mortality was among people that never took antiretrov<wbr></wbr>irals, the lowest among people on triple combinatio<wbr></wbr>ns (see table 1). \n\nWhat Duesberg does to try and explain away the data is pretend that the participan<wbr></wbr>ts in the Palella study were healthy before starting antiretrov<wbr></wbr>irals. This is not the case, all had &lt;100 CD4 T cells and many had previous opportunis<wbr></wbr>tic infections<wbr></wbr>. Duesberg et al have altered the quote from the Palella paper to make it seem like people with opportunis<wbr></wbr>tic infections were excluded. But this is what the quote says in the actual paper:\n\n\"Patients with a diagnosis of cytomegalo<wbr></wbr>virus retinitis or M. avium complex disease before study entry or during the first 30 days of follow-up and patients with active P. carinii pneumonia at the beginning of follow-up were excluded from the analyses of the incidence of that opportunis<wbr></wbr>tic infection.<wbr></wbr>\"\n\nIn other words, they weren\'t excluded from the study, they just weren\'t counted as having developed that particular opportunis<wbr></wbr>tic infection during the study, if it was pre-existi<wbr></wbr>ng or developed during he first 30 days. Because the sentence, in its original form, is also an acknowledg<wbr></wbr>ement that people entered the study with a history of opportunis<wbr></wbr>tic infections and not just low CD4 counts - i.e. not \"asymptoma<wbr></wbr>tic\" or \"AIDS free\" as Duesberg is claiming - Duesberg accomplish<wbr></wbr>es a double deception just by inserting a period after the word \"excluded.<wbr></wbr>\" \n\nThe fact that the Palella paper reports data on people who never took antiretrov<wbr></wbr>irals also contradict<wbr></wbr>s Duesberg\'s statement that \"Neither of these studies mentions drug-free controls.\"\n\nThe late Martin Delaney of Project Inform also wrote a letter to the NAS many years ago demanding that they review Duesberg\'s membership<wbr></wbr>; as far as I know he never received a response. I\'ll post a copy if I can find it. " });

Instead, he has authored many review articles in which sources and statistics appear to be selected to match his hypothesis that HIV does not cause AIDS. His \"Medical Hypotheses<wbr></wbr>\" is not the first example. In other articles, for example his 2003 review in the \"Journal of Bioscience<wbr></wbr>,\" he makes very questionab<wbr></wbr>le statements about the work of other scientists<wbr></wbr>, statements some would consider outright misreprese<wbr></wbr>ntation. On the side, Duesberg has made it his business to advise individual HIV-positi<wbr></wbr>ve people to avoid medical treatment. The late Christine Maggiore sought out Duesberg\'s advice before becoming an AIDS denialist activist..<wbr></wbr>.and foregoing treatment, including during pregnancy. She passed the infection to her daughter; both are now dead. Also dead are hundreds of thousands in South Africa, who were denied antiretrov<wbr></wbr>irals under the regime of Thabo Mbeki. He began to question HIV as the cause of AIDS after reading Duesberg\'s website, and he invited Duesberg to advise him on AIDS policy. The victims of this scientific irresponsi<wbr></wbr>bility, sadly, never received a letter of reprimand, and they were dismissed from this life, not from a comfortabl<wbr></wbr>e academic position." });

These masses are toward the lower ends of the PDG uncertaint<wbr></wbr>ies.  But this cannot account alone for the stair-step of masses in the N particle Series for instance, or any other of the baryon series.  These series arise because each quark also has a less basic (but precise) alternate mass toward the upper end of the PDG uncertaint<wbr></wbr>ies, not an isomer.  And these higher masses arise one at a time in place of the lower ones, with the heaviest N particle having only the higher masses at the top step of the stairs.  All are covered by a simple power/expo<wbr></wbr>nential law derived from the PDG tables.  At each step of the N or Delta, etc., series of heavier quark substituti<wbr></wbr>on options there is a group of the particles with a lightest group leader and typically two isomers of slightly greater mass.  All very systematic<wbr></wbr>, and without having to rely on an infinity of virtuals.-<wbr></wbr>---- It will be interestin<wbr></wbr>g to see what account the PDG takes of the Davies group\'s new calculatio<wbr></wbr>ns" });

JSReplyMSGId('jst-1', 'jsid-1271889671-760', { "TS": 1271889671, "Text": "Yes, but mathematic<wbr></wbr>al law does not translate to physical law. It depends on what is meant by \"proven\". Tenets of pure mathematic<wbr></wbr>s can be proven because they are absolutes- mathematic<wbr></wbr>al law- but these can only model the real world, not define it. Using your example, thermodyna<wbr></wbr>mics cannot be mathematic<wbr></wbr>ally proven, only modeled, because it is a physical principle. The closest you can get to scientific \"proof\" is through experiment<wbr></wbr>ation, but even then it cannot be verified under all possible circumstan<wbr></wbr>ces, so it remains a physical model (albeit a very good one), not a true physical law. It\'s great when pure math and real data tightly agree as it suggests the mathematic<wbr></wbr>al model is accurate- quantum mechanics has done very well in this regard. But a mathematic<wbr></wbr>ally-based idea is not particular<wbr></wbr>ly useful in the physical world until it has an experiment<wbr></wbr>al or at least observatio<wbr></wbr>nal basis. That is why some things like string theory or faster-tha<wbr></wbr>n-light theories do not at present fulfill the definition of theory- they are mathematic<wbr></wbr>al models only but without direct physical evidence, so they aren\'t yet, as you said, \"functiona<wbr></wbr>l\" models- they are indeed mathematic<wbr></wbr>al hypotheses about the physical world. Which gets to my original point- calling every new idea in physics that is so far based only on calculatio<wbr></wbr>n (including this one) a scientific \"theory\" is not only misleading<wbr></wbr>, but feeds the misunderst<wbr></wbr>andings about the meaning of the term among the general public- i.e. \"it\'s only a theory\"." });

It is time for the true movement to take it back from Duesberg and his hatchet man David Crowe and his handmaiden<wbr></wbr>s Celia Farber and Clark Baker to give it up. The real HIV dissident movement will gladly join and give testimony that they are exactly right- Duesberg has huge conflicts of interest. He sold us all out to cozy up to South Africa. Real purisists KNOW THAT HIV DOES NOT EXIST AND THAT DUESBERG IS A DUEFUSS!!! It is time for the Perth group to rise! House of Numbers clearly shows that Duesberg is a fraud. It is time for true dissidents to declare their loyalty. Who has the guts to denounce the false prophet Duesberg? Now is the time to follow the truth- HIV does not exist, never existed, and Duesberg knows it." });

He\'s been hiding the fact that he has within the 4 years that he\'s been working with us. He said that he had contracted it in the first year he was with us. He\'s not a homosexual nor does his family have any history of life-threa<wbr></wbr>tening illnesses. His condition became public to our company 4 months after he told me. Him having AIDS became public because he died. I remembered that at one of our coffee break he pulled me aside and showed me an old scientific journal. Within it he showed me an article stating how HIV is nothing but a \"Harmless Passenger Virus\". I was very skeptical at that time, because even at our age of modernizat<wbr></wbr>ion and technology<wbr></wbr>, we still can\'t figure out certain parts of our human functions and why we\'re experienci<wbr></wbr>ng what were experienci<wbr></wbr>ng now. I am one of those people that wishes Peter Duesberg\'s hypothesis about HIV to become reality. That it really is  harmless is reversely proportion<wbr></wbr>al to what is happening now. There has already been 2 million deaths based on the statistics of 2008 and still growing." });

American taxpayers have contribute<wbr></wbr>d close to $300 billion to your sacred cause that AIDS is contagious and caused by HIV. There are hundreds of mainstream AIDS organizati<wbr></wbr>ons, perhaps thousands. You have numerous government<wbr></wbr>s, celebritie<wbr></wbr>s, commercial enterprise<wbr></wbr>s and millions of people around the world supporting and defending your beliefs. Compared to this arsenal, our numbers are microscopi<wbr></wbr>c. Our financial resources amount to only thousands of dollars spread over twenty years. In spite of astonishin<wbr></wbr>gly meager resources we continue to do our jobs as scientists<wbr></wbr>--and this upsets you no end.\r\n\r\nSo, what is behind your obvious hatred of us as individual<wbr></wbr>s? How do we threaten you? Do you take some kind of pleasure in vitriolic attacks? Or is it simple sport for entertainm<wbr></wbr>ent sake, knowing you are completely safe from rebuke and censure from above?\r\n\r\nYou say we are responsibl<wbr></wbr>e for the deaths of hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of people. If true, this would certainly warrant criminal charges. As moral creatures, why haven\'t you taken us to court on your best example or homicide? You have at your command tens of millions of dollars to prosecute us. What is stopping you? Every day you delay adds to you culpabilit<wbr></wbr>y in genocide. How do you sleep at night knowing the slaughter continues? When will you do your moral duty.\r\n\r\nDavid Rasnick, PhD" });

Let\'s talk about one, just one person you may have helped to an early grave with your supreme arrogance.  \r\n\r\nYou and your ilk act like you know more than all the scientists who have dedicated not only years and years of study but also years and years of research to this virus and this disease.  You aggressive<wbr></wbr>ly try to persuade other people that HIV does not exist.  You aggressive<wbr></wbr>ly try to persuade others that HIV meds are toxic and will kill them and the virus will not.  Then you have the supreme arrogance to say, \"we do not try to influence people to not take HIV meds\"!   You lie thru semantics.

The trials involved recruiting poor black South Africans with HIV, INSTRUCTIN<wbr></wbr>G THEM NOT TO TAKE effective antiretrov<wbr></wbr>irals, and providing them instead with vitamin supplement<wbr></wbr>s. These trials RESULTED IN AT LEAST FIVE KNOWN DEATHS, known to TAC, and possibly up to twelve.\nIn June, 2008, the South African Cape High Court RULED AGAINST RASNICK and other defendants associated with the Rath Foundation<wbr></wbr>, declaring their vitamin trials ILLEGAL and prohibitin<wbr></wbr>g the publicatio<wbr></wbr>n of false advertisem<wbr></wbr>ents for vitamins. The COURT ALSO STATED THAT HEALTH AUTHORITIE<wbr></wbr>S in South Africa have an OBLIGATION TO INVESTIGAT<wbr></wbr>E AND STOP ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES OF RASNICK and the Rath Foundation<wbr></wbr>." });

This is the type of person you are dealing with, and this was one of the reasons he had no friends or colleagues who would associate themselves with him.

This seems to be an essential part of galactic evolution. First came the super massive stars, then about one through ten million years latter came the black holes, then the merger of black holes followed by a large collection of hydrogen and helium by gravationa<wbr></wbr>l attraction .As a result, the birth of a galaxy complete with material for new stars. Some galaxies create new stars like burnning a candle at both ends, using most of the available hydrogen not leaving enough for additional star formation. There are many reasons for this including ; merging or passing galaxies causing shock waves that causes congealmen<wbr></wbr>t of nebulae thus a baby boom.  Stars born in one era will grow old and ten billion years latter will remain the only stars in the galaxy. This is caused mostly by an out side gravatatio<wbr></wbr>nal attraction (another galaxie) , causing super nova, gravationa<wbr></wbr>l collapse of nebulae triggering star formation,  and sweeping raw, unbound material from the galaxy leaving no raw material for new stars.\r\n\r\nIf a feeding super massive black hole emitting hard x -rays can halt new star formation, it certanly is not the only way it can be done.  It is my guess that the massive galaxies in these studies were old elipitical galaxies which has already gone through many collisions in the  past as do all galaxies. This may be the real correlatio<wbr></wbr>n.\r\nQuasars likely,are not considered in this study because of the great distances involved, not being able to resolve the stars. That\'s really too bad as this is an earlier epoc of the evolutiona<wbr></wbr>ry process in there studies.\r\nI do respect to the fullest this study by there last paragraph.\r\nAlso please  excuse my spelling..<wbr></wbr>.

But you can not change your decision (for example) to call in sick to work. Your boss, your co workers, your cell phone company\'s current existence all depend on what you did earlier. So changing that decision would actually change their past also.\n\nSpecial concern it taken such that these light particle\'s history does not affect other histories in the universe. THEN, we are allowed to change the light particles history at will.\n\nHope this helps," });

More likely the universe has a consciousn<wbr></wbr>ess? That way it would not be so far off as to single out small particles. Who knows... Zwei, your comment is more correct than any of ours.

I would have also thought that once the ice and snow has run off from the area around the vent, there would be less explosive activity?  Are there additional vents?  Does a dike connect Eyjafjalla<wbr></wbr>jokull and Katla?  Are we now seeing activity based on pressure more than explosive thermal contractio<wbr></wbr>n?

The drug was widely used by college students and age-peers in the 1960s and 1970s in North America, of course. But its use is a significan<wbr></wbr>t part of oral and writen histories of various Native American tribes and/or enclaves, with echoes reaching back to Asian and African cultures, as well. The ingestion of psilocybin was often a part of religious ceremonies and was chronicled with an unfortunat<wbr></wbr>e mixture of truth and imaginativ<wbr></wbr>e fiction in the cult-like books of a writer with the pseudonym Carlos Castenadas<wbr></wbr>, in his \"Don Juan\" stories of Hopi Indian practices. \r\n\r\nThe myths surroundin<wbr></wbr>g psilocybin have reached absurd levels in some cases. I have met a young (at the time) man who owned photograph<wbr></wbr>s of the mushroom sliced at different angles - in one, there was the suggestion of a kneeling, riant figure. This man was convinced, therefore, that the Lord Jesus Christ was actually a myth built around the mushroom and its spirituali<wbr></wbr>stic effects. " });

The example that comes to mind for me is Ascaris, which is quite possibly the most well researched nematode on earth.  The adult worms do live in the intestine, and they are  anaerobes, but they still have mitochondr<wbr></wbr>ia, and their embryos must have molecular oxygen to grow and develop.  The fertilized eggs need time outside of the body to develop and become infectious<wbr></wbr>.  They hatch after a host has swallowed the and the Juveniles need so much oxygen, that they migrate from the intestines through the circulator<wbr></wbr>y sytem and into the lungs where they grow.  When they are mature they migrate out of the lungs and into the mouth where they can then get swallowed.  Once they are back in the intestines<wbr></wbr>, they can be anaerobic again.   \r\nWith all of that said, you should see in the article that it noted finding various stages of the Loricifera life cycle in the anaerobic environmen<wbr></wbr>t.  Which suggested that it can spend it\'s entire life without O2.  That is a key difference<wbr></wbr>." });
