    "message": "Most parasites have very complex life cyles, and intestinal worms do not spend their entire life in an intestine.  The example that comes to mind for me is Ascaris, which is quite possibly the most well researched nematode on earth.  The adult worms do live in the intestine, and they are  anaerobes, but they still have mitochondria, and their embryos must have molecular oxygen to grow and develop.  The fertilized eggs need time outside of the body to develop and become infectious.  They hatch after a host has swallowed the and the Juveniles need so much oxygen, that they migrate from the intestines through the circulatory sytem and into the lungs where they grow.  When they are mature they migrate out of the lungs and into the mouth where they can then get swallowed.  Once they are back in the intestines, they can be anaerobic again.   \r\nWith all of that said, you should see in the article that it noted finding various stages of the Loricifera life cycle in the anaerobic environment.  Which suggested that it can spend it's entire life without O2.  That is a key difference.",

    "message": "Black holes don't exist, because it takes forever for a star to collapse to a point with zero volume and infinite density from our point of view as external observers. It's nice math from the point of view of the star itself, but it's not the reality in our frame of reference. The simple fact is that General Relativity breaks down in black holes. Singularity, i.e. an arbitary mass in a zero volume is nonsense. Forever lasting collapse into a black hole or matter forever approaching the event horizon as viewed by external observers is nonsense. Hawking has combined quantum mechanics with GR, while they do not agree at all. GR does not apply on small scale where QM applies, while QM does not apply on large scale where GR applies.",

The drug was widely used by college students and age-peers in the 1960s and 1970s in North America, of course. But its use is a significant part of oral and writen histories of various Native American tribes and/or enclaves, with echoes reaching back to Asian and African cultures, as well. The ingestion of psilocybin was often a part of religious ceremonies and was chronicled with an unfortunate mixture of truth and imaginative fiction in the cult-like books of a writer with the pseudonym Carlos Castenadas, in his \"Don Juan\" stories of Hopi Indian practices. \r\n\r\nThe myths surrounding psilocybin have reached absurd levels in some cases. I have met a young (at the time) man who owned photographs of the mushroom sliced at different angles - in one, there was the suggestion of a kneeling, riant figure. This man was convinced, therefore, that the Lord Jesus Christ was actually a myth built around the mushroom and its spiritualistic effects. ",

The BBC researchers designed their own cognitive stimulation program, applied it at a very low intensity in healthy young people, and then saw no effect on cognitive function.  To then claim that their data shows that \"computerized mental workouts don't boost mental skills\" is akin to saying \"sugar doesn't help with a headache, and sugar and aspirin are both molecules, so aspirin must not help with headaches either.\"  This is an elementary logical fallacy.\n\nThe only conclusion from the BBC study is that very limited amounts of everyday cognitive stimulation does not improve cognitive function.  This is an interesting conclusion, and the study should have reported it as such.\n\nHenry Mahncke\nI am a researcher at Posit Science, where I design and test cognitive training programs.\n\n",

Risky projects also affect the researchers willing to take on such research projects, as they are also potentially throwing their careers into a game of scientific Russian roulette. Particularly for non-tenured academic scientists, risky projects can make or break a career. However, such potential discoveries are often the most fruitful for scientific advancements, and it is encouraging to see efforts being made to lessen the hesitation of academics towards undertaking high-stakes projects. After all, agencies such as the NSF should be encouraging promising scientists and their projects, lest we all suffer the consequences of missing out on their latent scientific contributions.",

I'll take that with a pound of salt. \r\nI already said this on this post, but I'll repeat: HisWholiness believes (i.e. has faith) that a tasteless, colorless gas (hydrogen) - through time - became people. You can't get any more religious than that!  \r\nIf macroevolution is a fact, then why doesn't jeff levinton mention any of these facts in his 2nd edition (Cambridge Press)? Why didn't steve gould in his *Structure of Evolutionary Theory* ('02) - bursting at over 1400 pages? Why didn't ayala & valentine in their 1979 text I used in grad school (zoology)? C'mon *HisWholiness* instead of name-calling get with the program and list all those alleged facts of macroevolution. Good luck because you'll certainly need it.  ",

Climate models take into account ONLY direct solar insolation, NOT the effects of solar activity on indirect effects such as this article is addressing, as well as the increasingly researched area of the effect of solar activity on El Nino - La Nina patterns (as a paper from the Nat'l Center for Atmospheric Research pointed out) as well as the quantity of cosmic rays reaching earth's atmosphere which affects cloud condensation nuclei and concomitant global cloud cover.  Feedbacks are the issue here, not direct solar insolation which your point addresses.\n\nAlso, CO2 (when \"actually doing the math\") has only very limited effects on global temperature.  The models depend on the secondary effects of water vapor to reach their alarmist temperature increase conclusions.  \n\nCO2 also has a logarithmic contribution to temperature--meaning that it's contribution to the greenhouse effect is largest in the lower end of its addition to the atmosphere (the great majority of heating from CO2 is already in play).  At some point, no matter how much CO2 you add to the atmosphere, it can add only miniscule theoretical rises of temperature.  If it were simply a matter of the math of direct CO2 accumulation, we'd never have had the global cooling from the 1940s to the 70s or during the recent past decade.  Natural variability can obviously overwhelm any effect by CO2.",

When this volcano first started to erupt, I was a little surprised that we weren't seeing a phreatomagmatic event - the heat of the lava coming into contact with the snow and ice causing explosive thermal contraction, and a large plinian ash column and many lahars.  It seems like we now have had/are experiencing this kind of activity at Eyjafjallajokull.  I guess it makes sense that a change in magma type would cause this.  But there's no mention of a basalt-type magma here, and I thought (from my brief readings) that that was the sort of magma likely to fragment into dangerous angular lapilli and ash?  I would have also thought that once the ice and snow has run off from the area around the vent, there would be less explosive activity?  Are there additional vents?  Does a dike connect Eyjafjallajokull and Katla?  Are we now seeing activity based on pressure more than explosive thermal contraction?  I'd be interested to hear a vulcanologist's take on the situation.",

    "message": "Another note (my last post was a response to Kati and Michelle),\n\nMelanie,\n\nThe idea has not been ruled out that particles have some sort of consciousness.  But, this is unlikely. It would mean that blocks of wood and metal have consciousness also. But again, this has not been ruled out. And quite a few physicists believe this. More likely the universe has a consciousness? That way it would not be so far off as to single out small particles. Who knows... Zwei, your comment is more correct than any of ours. No one quite knows what is  going on \"down there\" in the quantum world.\n\nOn this subject, on youtube, there lies my video project on this exact subject. Hope you enjoy!

But you can not change your decision (for example) to call in sick to work. Your boss, your co workers, your cell phone company's current existence all depend on what you did earlier. So changing that decision would actually change their past also.\n\nSpecial concern it taken such that these light particle's history does not affect other histories in the universe.

    "message": "I would bet my last dollar that every galaxy has a super massive black hole in its center, also that every globular cluster has an intermediate black hole in its center.  This seems to be an essential part of galactic evolution. First came the super massive stars, then about one through ten million years latter came the black holes, then the merger of black holes followed by a large collection of hydrogen and helium by gravational attraction .As a result, the birth of a galaxy complete with material for new stars. Some galaxies create new stars like burnning a candle at both ends, using most of the available hydrogen not leaving enough for additional star formation. There are many reasons for this including ; merging or passing galaxies causing shock waves that causes congealment of nebulae thus a baby boom.  Stars born in one era will grow old and ten billion years latter will remain the only stars in the galaxy. This is caused mostly by an out side gravatational attraction (another galaxie) , causing super nova, gravational collapse of nebulae triggering star formation,  and sweeping raw, unbound material from the galaxy leaving no raw material for new stars.\r\n\r\nIf a feeding super massive black hole emitting hard x -rays can halt new star formation, it certanly is not the only way it can be done.  It is my guess that the massive galaxies in these studies were old elipitical galaxies which has already gone through many collisions in the  past as do all galaxies. This may be the real correlation.\r\nQuasars likely,are not considered in this study because of the great distances involved, not being able to resolve the stars. That's really too bad as this is an earlier epoc of the evolutionary process in there studies.\r\nI do respect to the fullest this study by there last paragraph.\r\nAlso please  excuse my spelling...

This is the type of person you are dealing with, and this was one of the reasons he had no friends or colleagues who would associate themselves with him.

Or perhaps Statistics South Africa when they publish that on average there were only 12,000 \"HIV\" deaths per year from 2000-2006.\n\nWhy not go after James Chin former WHO employee and UC Berkeley Professor when he writes,\n\n\"\u201cFurthermore, most uncritically accept and use information distributed by UNAIDS, an organization that doesn't deny it is primarily an AIDS advocacy agency- not a scientific or technical agency. As a result, there continues to be inadequate understanding of basic HIV epidemiology-especially its transmission dynamics- along with gross ignorance of how current HIV/AIDS estimates and projections are 'cooked' or made up\u201d\n\nAcademic freedom is not a privilege, it is a constitutional protection. To borrow from the Gottfredson paper for your own education in what academic freedom is and is not.\n\n\"There is no legal redress against lawful speech, no matter how noxious or disturbing it is.  Indeed, that is the rationale for both academic freedom and the First Amendment-to protect the expression of ideas we might fervently wish to forbid, regulate, or punish.  That urge to ban is strong and incessant so its prohibition must be equally certain and encompassing.  Universities may not carve out exceptions for ideas that frighten or offend\"\n\n",

You have some deep-seated issues and can't face the realities of what you have done:\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rasnick\n\nDavid Rasnick has worked with Matthias Rath in South Africa, where they have emphasized the purported risks of antiretroviral therapy and URGED HIV/AIDS patients TO USE VITAMIN AND NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS INSTEAD. David Rasnick and the Rath Foundation became the subject of a lawsuit by the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) in South Africa. The lawsuit was brought as a result of clinical trials conducted by David Rasnick and the Rath Foundation that WERE NOT APPROVED by the appropriate authorities in South Africa and DID NOT UNDERGO ANY ETHICAL REVIEW. The trials involved recruiting poor black South Africans with HIV, INSTRUCTING THEM NOT TO TAKE effective antiretrovirals, and providing them instead with vitamin supplements. These trials RESULTED IN AT LEAST FIVE KNOWN DEATHS, known to TAC, and possibly up to twelve.\nIn June, 2008, the South African Cape High Court RULED AGAINST RASNICK and other defendants associated with the Rath Foundation, declaring their vitamin trials ILLEGAL and prohibiting the publication of false advertisements for vitamins. The COURT ALSO STATED THAT HEALTH AUTHORITIES in South Africa have an OBLIGATION TO INVESTIGATE AND STOP ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES OF RASNICK and the Rath Foundation.",

Their claim \u2013 that HIV is not the main cause of AIDS \u2013 puts them at odds with the scientific community. Regarding his level of expertise on HIV/AIDS, Rasnick states that his own research on rat proteases[3] did not involve HIV/AIDS:\n...my own research...had nothing to do with AIDS.\nRasnick has proposed that HIV testing be completely outlawed.\n\nDavid Rasnick has claimed to be a visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. However, in response to a 2006 editorial in which David Rasnick claimed affiliation with the university, the chairman of Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of California, Berkeley wrote:\nI understand David Rasnick claimed an affiliation with our department in an article. David Rasnick has no affiliation with the University of California, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology. One should obviously be concerned that someone who misrepresents his own affiliation might also misrepresent data and arguments in other areas.\n\nLet's talk about \"credibility\" David, huh?",

You really seem stuck on the 300,000+ number.  Forget that.  Let's talk about one, just one person you may have helped to an early grave with your supreme arrogance.  \r\n\r\nYou and your ilk act like you know more than all the scientists who have dedicated not only years and years of study but also years and years of research to this virus and this disease.  You aggressively try to persuade other people that HIV does not exist.  You aggressively try to persuade others that HIV meds are toxic and will kill them and the virus will not.  Then you have the supreme arrogance to say, \"we do not try to influence people to not take HIV meds\"!   You lie thru semantics.   You and those AIDS Deanialists also lie by misrepresenting peer reveiewed data when you say that HIV has not been isolated.  You lie when you say the peer reviewed data does not support that HAART has drastically extended life expectancy of HIV+ people.  When you say that HIV testing is not accurate, you lie.  When Duesberg and Farber say there has never been a pathogenic retrovirus outside of the laboratory setting is an absurd lie.\r\n\r\nI could go on, but maybe you get my point.  Maybe you do not.  Or, just maybe, you will ignore my point, pretend it is not true, and go on tilting at windmills.\r\nJ. Todd DeShong",

You told Newweek Magazine \"The whole dissident idea attracts crazies. And then all of a sudden, without realizing it, you've become one of them.\" But you do not have to stay one of them.

I think it safe to say few have enjoyed the privilege of academic freedom more than I have. I recognize this privilege and know it is not a right. If I abuse the privilege it should be taken away. If I am found to have used it to harm others, I should be removed from my university. If I have been found to contribute to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, to openly tell people to ignore a life-threatening diagnosis, and to refute science only to propagate my own self-indulging ideas, I should be prosecuted. Peter Duesberg should be plead guilty, step down from his position, give up his affiliation with UC Berkeley, and resign his membership from the National Academy of Sciences.

American taxpayers have contributed close to $300 billion to your sacred cause that AIDS is contagious and caused by HIV. There are hundreds of mainstream AIDS organizations, perhaps thousands. You have numerous governments, celebrities, commercial enterprises and millions of people around the world supporting and defending your beliefs. Compared to this arsenal, our numbers are microscopic. Our financial resources amount to only thousands of dollars spread over twenty years. In spite of astonishingly meager resources we continue to do our jobs as scientists--and this upsets you no end.\r\n\r\nSo, what is behind your obvious hatred of us as individuals? How do we threaten you? Do you take some kind of pleasure in vitriolic attacks? Or is it simple sport for entertainment sake, knowing you are completely safe from rebuke and censure from above?\r\n\r\nYou say we are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of people. If true, this would certainly warrant criminal charges. As moral creatures, why haven't you taken us to court on your best example or homicide? You have at your command tens of millions of dollars to prosecute us. What is stopping you? Every day you delay adds to you culpability in genocide. How do you sleep at night knowing the slaughter continues? When will you do your moral duty.\r\n\r\nDavid Rasnick, PhD",

He's been hiding the fact that he has within the 4 years that he's been working with us. He said that he had contracted it in the first year he was with us. He's not a homosexual nor does his family have any history of life-threatening illnesses. His condition became public to our company 4 months after he told me. Him having AIDS became public because he died. I remembered that at one of our coffee break he pulled me aside and showed me an old scientific journal. Within it he showed me an article stating how HIV is nothing but a \"Harmless Passenger Virus\". I was very skeptical at that time, because even at our age of modernization and technology, we still can't figure out certain parts of our human functions and why we're experiencing what were experiencing now. I am one of those people that wishes Peter Duesberg's hypothesis about HIV to become reality. That it really is  harmless is reversely proportional to what is happening now. There has already been 2 million deaths based on the statistics of 2008 and still growing.",

He spends the majority of his time on Seth Kalichmans (denyingaids) and Todd Deshongs (dissidents@dumbees) blogsites abusing all and sundry who enter in to a deabte on this topic, and usually ends with the comment \"how's Kym Bannon going?\". Kym incidentally is a woman near death. Such are the levels that the self appointed protectors of the HIV/AIDS paradigm will sink to. Take the time to have a look at their sites and then make a judgement as to where you want to place your faith in the honesty of the combatants.\n\nSeth Kalichman has admitted on his own site that he gets paid as a part of his faculty duties to run his blog. His faculty receives large amounts of funding from the pharmaceutical industry and yet he claims never to have received a dollar and has no conflicts of interest.\n\nThis particular complaint was lodged by the Treatment Action Campaign in South Africa. That organisation receives copious funding from pharmaceutical companies as well, and of course there is no conflict of interest there either.\n\nIn any event, Duesberg wrote a paper that disputed the amount of deaths attributed to AIDS in South Africa. His figures were based on the official statistics as kept by the South African Government. The TAC response in collaboration with AIDSTRUTH was to publish a pharma funded paper written by Max Essex and others which claimed the death rate was some orders of magnitude higher, 14,500 official versus 330,00 calcuated through meta analysis of pharma funded studies. Once again no conflict of interest is ackowledged.\n\nPhase 2 was to lodge a complaint against Duesberg claiming a Co-author David Rasnick has a conflict of interest with a Matias Rath. Even though Rath and Rasnick have had nothing to do with each other for 3 years.\n\nPhase 3 was to headline in all pro pharma blogs that Duesberg is under investigation.\n\nEven blind Freddy can see that this is an orchestrated campaign against an individual who has dared to question the orthodox point of view, even though he is emminently qualified to do so. This is the state of our modern \"scientific\" community and the lengths they will go to in order to secure their own positions and protect the income obtained from the pharma tit they suckle on.\n\nThe comment was made, is he an AIDS scientist or a scientist. There should be a clear distinction there as AIDS science was corrupted long long ago by the people who only sought to produce another Block Buster drug for the shareholders. ",

It means that many more graduate researchers whose proposals were turned down for funding in years past have the opportunity to pursue novel research in their fields. Of course, the expansion is because of President Obama's support for expanding the program, but I still think it is a really bold move. Congratulations to all the 2010 fellows!",

    "message": "Yes, but mathematical law does not translate to physical law. It depends on what is meant by \"proven\". Tenets of pure mathematics can be proven because they are absolutes- mathematical law- but these can only model the real world, not define it. Using your example, thermodynamics cannot be mathematically proven, only modeled, because it is a physical principle. The closest you can get to scientific \"proof\" is through experimentation, but even then it cannot be verified under all possible circumstances, so it remains a physical model (albeit a very good one), not a true physical law. It's great when pure math and real data tightly agree as it suggests the mathematical model is accurate- quantum mechanics has done very well in this regard. But a mathematically-based idea is not particularly useful in the physical world until it has an experimental or at least observational basis. That is why some things like string theory or faster-than-light theories do not at present fulfill the definition of theory- they are mathematical models only but without direct physical evidence, so they aren't yet, as you said, \"functional\" models- they are indeed mathematical hypotheses about the physical world. Which gets to my original point- calling every new idea in physics that is so far based only on calculation (including this one) a scientific \"theory\" is not only misleading, but feeds the misunderstandings about the meaning of the term among the general public- i.e. \"it's only a theory\".",

That is a pure Farber tactic.\nPlease show where Kalichman was paid $17 million to \"blog pharmaceutical propaganda\". Put up, or shut up you schmuck. Jeffrey's case was thrown out with Farber's lawyer under investigation by the NY State Bar. Just because histrionic Farber filed something to try and get her more failed publicity doesn't make anything valid, and you know that.\n\nI know you have many regrets after singing with the Los Angeles Gay Mens' Chorus, but calling people \"heterophobes\" is not a way for you to deal with your own self-loathing.\n\nBy the way, how's Kim Bannon doing after she listened to the denialists? Oh wait - what about Maggiore!",

We know that people who have pleasant manners and calm going both in their mind /heart and outside are prone to less health problems. Aggressive people and those who feel lot of tensions, irrespective of their financial condition are prone to more strokes and more death rate. Exhausting energy is slightly different from spending energy out of aggressive behavior. Someone who spends energy by physical work and being calm may not have the same condition of an aggressive person",

This can't happen when the nebula gets swept clean.\n\nThe real question isn't whether this process represents the dividing line between dead and alive galaxies. It's whether the SMBH is really pumping out enough radiation to devastate material as much as these researchers say it is. I would say.. it's fairly likely they are wrong. Emitted spherically, the energy density (dissipating with the square) would have to be something (at the origin) approaching our Universe's original singularity.",

    "message": "I showed in Florida Scientist Vol 68, #3 (2005) (see my website for a copy) that there is a very simple way of determining from the PDG data tables that the proper mass of the up quark which occurs in the simpler baryons such as protons and neutrons is 1.914 MeV (rounded) with the similarly identified down quark at 5.11 MeV.  These masses are toward the lower ends of the PDG uncertainties.  But this cannot account alone for the stair-step of masses in the N particle Series for instance, or any other of the baryon series.  These series arise because each quark also has a less basic (but precise) alternate mass toward the upper end of the PDG uncertainties, not an isomer.  And these higher masses arise one at a time in place of the lower ones, with the heaviest N particle having only the higher masses at the top step of the stairs.  All are covered by a simple power/exponential law derived from the PDG tables.  At each step of the N or Delta, etc., series of heavier quark substitution options there is a group of the particles with a lightest group leader and typically two isomers of slightly greater mass.  All very systematic, and without having to rely on an infinity of virtuals.----- It will be interesting to see what account the PDG takes of the Davies group's new calculations",

Nicholson\":\nWell as a \"youth still learning\" allow me to educate you for a moment:\nA marketplace of ideas is fine, just not a marketplace to promote false ideas that demonstrably result in hundreds of thousands of preventable and unnecessary deaths.  There are basic limits and by mislabeling science and medicine that is proven as \"orthodoxy\" you demote it to the level that denialists desire. They seek an equal platform for false statements, wrong assumptions, and deathly results. Just ask anyone how Kim Bannon is doing. Or Christine Maggiore. The only arbiter of truth on AIDS is science, peer-reviewed journals, and those who are qualified to understand it. And that isn't you, obviously. But nor is it fired, uneducated ex-cops like Clark Baker, or histrionic unemployed \"journalists\" like Celia Farber who tend to lead this denialist movement. At least they claim to.\n",

It is from a recent paper published in an Elsevier journal, Personality and Individual Differences. \n\n\"The public sphere should be a marketplace for ideas and not a venue for enforcing orthodoxy, and, second, institutions of higher learning are especially important generators of the knowledge and inquiry required to lift the repressive hand of received wisdom.\"-L. Gottfredson (http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2009academicfreedom.pdf)\n\nBut if you disagree with it perhaps you can have it censored.  That is how science works nowadays, right? As a youth I am still learning. Alternatively maybe you could come after my job and livelihood since we are in disagreement.  After all you are the arbiter of truth on AIDS...or is that the job AIDStruth.com    \n\n-Joshua Nicholson\n\n\n\n",

Anyone can sue anyone for anything - and the suit from Farber not only expired but has no merit and has resulted in bar complaints against her idiot-lawyer. In fact, the idiot lawyer had to get a malpractice attorney to defend him. Celia Farber, like you, is a histrionic attention whore who is narcissistic and thinks that they are relevant to anything. It is a badge of honor that your asses got kicked by a legitimate law firm.\n\nClark Baker exemplifies the Dunning-Kruger effect!!\nFrom: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning\u2013Kruger_effect\n\nThe Dunning\u2013Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which \"people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it\". The unskilled therefore suffer from illusory superiority, rating their own ability as above average, much higher than in actuality.\n\nNow go back to being yourself at your best, you fired cop, and spend your time at your \"post office box of medical justice\" even though you have yet to even graduate from college.  Maybe you need some more therapy - the LA Times already ran an article saying that you were in intensive therapy for abusive behavior.\n\nBy the way, you have yet to name a single case you have been involved in with that fraud post office box. You are a liar, a fraud, and a certifiable loser and nut who scurries around like a gnat and makes stupid accusations in some sort of futile hope of seeming more relevant. Go away - you annoy.",

    "message": "Your idea sounds good until you ask anyone who actually knows how to do the math to figure out how much cooling or warming can possibly be caused by a given increase in solar activity. The increase in solar activity would have to have been 3-10 times greater to explain the increase in average temperatures. \nBelow I posted a link to one paper that assumed the maximum possible increase allowed by measures of past solar activity. I could have posted many more but all the papers/research on this seem to say the sun can be in it alone.\n\nhttp://www.agu.org/journals/ja/ja0305/2002JA009753/\n\nAverage temperatures have only been deceasing since 2006. I do not feel that four years is enough data to be confident that it is part of a trend. I would wait for the measurements of the next decade before making overconfident remarks.\n\nPhysicists have been doing calculations on how much warming or cooling may result from changes in atmospheric gas compositions for several decades. The numbers of what to expect from changes in CO2 concentrations have become more precise but still remain significant in spite of all the research. CO2 is not off the hook for anything yet nor is it the only greenhouse gas. I would give it another 30 years of temperature measurements and advancements in climate models.",

His astonishing early career brought him recognition, tenure and election to the National Academy of Sciences. Now into his third decade of telling people that HIV is harmless, Duesberg continues to deny the science of AIDS at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives. His Professorship and membership in the National Academy lend credibility to conspiracy theorist David Rasnick, who is happy to tell people who test HIV positive to ignore their HIV test results. It is time that universities realize their role in protecting the public from harm done by demented tenured faculty who use the name of their esteemed institution to inflict harm on public health. If there has ever been a case for post-tenure review and ejection from the National Academy of Science, Peter Duesberg is that case. I hope that UC Berkeley is able to once and for all deal with their Duesbergf problem. \nSeth Kalichman\nUniversity of Connecticut",

Deprived of that soil, it is *as capable of decay & death as any other human activity, such as religion or a system of government.\" What is that unique soil? Eiseley IDs it, reluctantly, as the Christian faith HisWholinus. \r\n*In one of those strange permutations of which history yields occasional rare examples,* he says, *it is the Christian world which finally gave birth in a clear, articulate fashion to the experimental method of science itself.* - Darwin's Century, Doubleday, 1958, p. 18  ",

At the moment of mors the participant of group sends a signal to all terms of group is enlarges an issue and cancels losses. The group closed by a feedback to become immortal. At HS the feedback is realised differently. The dying person sees favourite and close to it people (the virtual reality is faultless), all gain the information on mors and a command on organism restoration. Losses of the term of group it is cancelled by augmentation of life expectancy of addressees.\r\n\r\nThe program disposable - everyone, gone through clinical mors get constant access to this program. It is enough to recollect any person to cure it. Motions of arms are thus urged, but are not binding, however it generates set of simulators. They are studied by the same scientists. Effect - a zero.\r\n\r\nBase effect - boundless exterior memory on gravitational waves.\r\n\r\nBy-effect of exterior memory - treatment is indifferent to distance.\r\n\r\nTreatment by-effect - telepathy - information interchange out of distance.\r\n\r\nTelepathy by-effect - clairvoyance - information interchange out of time.\r\n\r\nIn a basis - use of the modulated gravitational waves for storage and an information transfer. Gravitational waves - a variant electromagnetic, but rate of diffusion misses. Bilaterial modulation is not obvious and can be found out only casually. Once will carry also to you. Can be.\r\n\r\nTHE UNIVERSE AS ILLUSION\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLet's define speed of distribution of gravitation. Two bodies are drawn with any force and to change her it is possible only change of distance between them - i.e. having displaced one of bodies - we shall cause change of force that will lead to to displacement of the second body, or, otherwise, displacing the first body - we create a gravitational wave, observing displacement of the second body - is registered her. However to change position of a body it is possible only with the help of the third body, changing simultaneously and his position - two gravitational waves compensating each other are created. Unique observable effect - resistance of a body to attempts to change his position.\r\n\r\nLet's consider our attempts a little differently. Gravitational interaction is carried out on the lines connecting the centers of weights, - let it there will be gravitational strings. What properties of them to give? We shall displace a body, from set of gravitational strings we shall choose two, strictly forward and back on a direction of movement. The first will be compressed, the second two zones - compression and under pressures will be stretched, will be dragged out, formed, and everyone aspires to return a body in an initial point. Having displaced a body, it is necessary to keep it while waves of compression and under pressure will not disperse on all length gravitational strings. But in the infinite flat universe it gives nothing - at any final speed of gravitation time of deduction indefinitely. We shall close the universe. Waves of compression and under pressure will swallow up each other, there is time of deduction - time of movement of a wave on a circle. Let time of movement a zero. Then the inert weight is instant gravitational reaction of the closed universe.\r\n\r\nEinstein has proved it more elegantly. If gravitation is a curvature of space the infinite straight line is closed - moving on by her, we shall return to an initial point. But to return to an initial point it is possible only during initial time, duration of such movement is equal to zero, speed is higher light and has forbidden the proof. Simply on  has overlooked - to divide on a zero is impossible and instantly - is not faster, it is incommensurable with C.\r\n\r\nIdea of Newton, principle of the Mach, Einstein's proof - all for a long time is known, however some consequences can represent insignificant interest. So:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe inert weight is instant gravitational reaction of the closed universe\r\n\r\nBut if the space is closed, time also is closed\r\n\r\nBut then the universe has no neither the beginnings, nor the end\r\n\r\nBut then time of life U. is equal to zero\r\n\r\nBut then at U. infinite set of lives\r\n\r\nBut then they are not necessarily identical\r\n\r\nBut then at everyone the set of interactions\r\n\r\nBut then, probably, there is even one set of interactions closing space and time in infinity\r\n\r\nAnd all this simultaneously, i.e. develops.\r\n\r\nBut then begins cinema - if the infinite set is virtual-lethal U. in the sum is given by a zero, infinite set identical, is virtual-immortal U., being imposed, create illusion real U.\r\n\r\nIllusion - any attempt to specify the microcosm device gives return result for on the one hand reduces density real U., and with another does visible reduction process to zero of the sum virtual, there are the interactions which do not have any rights on \r\n\r\n       The fine idea of knowledge of the world generates phantoms - and what with them now to make?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    It is curious, that spatial isolation is reflected by an equivalence principle, time isolation - an uncertainty principle, both naked fixing - the devil only knows why, but heavy and inert weights are completely not casually equal, and any attempt to specify device V yields strictly return result.\r\n\r\n        Artificiality both is obvious - whether their further presence is justified?\r\n\r\nDetecting of gravitational waves not a problem - longitudinal waves create inert weight, cross-section - electromagnetic radiation, the third variant - electro-gravitational waves is presented unevidently that is why it is not known. Small misunderstanding, not noteworthy.\r\n\r\n \r\n",

Instead, he has authored many review articles in which sources and statistics appear to be selected to match his hypothesis that HIV does not cause AIDS. His \"Medical Hypotheses\" is not the first example. In other articles, for example his 2003 review in the \"Journal of Bioscience,\" he makes very questionable statements about the work of other scientists, statements some would consider outright misrepresentation. On the side, Duesberg has made it his business to advise individual HIV-positive people to avoid medical treatment. The late Christine Maggiore sought out Duesberg's advice before becoming an AIDS denialist activist...and foregoing treatment, including during pregnancy. She passed the infection to her daughter; both are now dead. Also dead are hundreds of thousands in South Africa, who were denied antiretrovirals under the regime of Thabo Mbeki. He began to question HIV as the cause of AIDS after reading Duesberg's website, and he invited Duesberg to advise him on AIDS policy. The victims of this scientific irresponsibility, sadly, never received a letter of reprimand, and they were dismissed from this life, not from a comfortable academic position.",

    "message": "Martin Delaney's letter to NAS, from July 31, 1997. \n\nDr. Bruce Alberts\nPresident, National Academy of Sciences\n2101 Constitution Ave., NW\nWashington, DC 20418\n\nJuly 31, 1997\n\nDear Dr. Alberts,\n\nI am writing as the head of a nationally known AIDS organization and as a representative of a larger group of AIDS service providers. I am also a member of the NIAID Council and a member of the former Medicine Roundtable on the Developments of Drugs and Vaccines for AIDS. I am writing today to seek your attention and advice on a matter which has come to trouble almost all of us working in the AIDS service field.\n\nOur concern is the continuing public campaign of Peter Duesberg to convince the public, people at risk of HIV infection, and people already infected that they are in no danger from this virus, that AIDS is solely a behavioral disease, and that current treatments for the disease and recreational drug abuse are in fact the cause of the disease. I have followed this debate for more than a decade and have yet to see any meaningful scientific evidence that supports these views. Instead, over the years I've seen a rapid accumulation of evidence that conclusively disproves his viewpoint. His views have long ceased to be a topic of serious discussion within the scientific community. Having lost the debate with his peers, he has taken his campaign to the public and directly to the people most vulnerable- young and poorly informed people struggling with HIV infection. He fans a natural inclination toward denial on the part of such people, giving them a seemingly legitimate way to ignore a positive HIV antibody test, to cast aside the difficult behavioral changes associated with safe sex, and to forego the complex challenge of multi-drug combination therapy. Obviously, such a deceptively attractive package will find a ready audience.\n\nNo one opposing his views wishes to discourage his academic freedom, nor do I see evidence that this has been done in any way. Though he claims his views on AIDS are responsible for the loss of NIH grants, it is far more likely that this is due to his lack of contribution and publication in his own field over the last decade. The scientific community has shown unprecedented tolerance for his behavior, as well-meaning people hoped that the airing of his views would lead him to see his errors. Such is not the case. Just as the right of free speech doesn't sanction the person who yells \"fire\" in a crowded theater, neither does academic freedom provide blanket protection for irresponsible behavior by scientists which adversely affects the public health.\n\nPerhaps most troubling is the degree to which his current campaign has come to flaunt the scientific method. His disregard for accuracy and integrity in the scientific process is amply demonstrated in the lengthy review published in 1995 in Science Magazine by Jon Cohen. In this and in Duesbergs own recent book, even the most junior of trained observers can see how he chooses to overlook all data which contradicts his conclusions, while misstating and distorting the data on several aspects of the disease. I had the misfortune of debating Professor Duesberg and his cohort Kary Mullis together in 1995 and found both strangely ignorant of some of the simplest principles of drug Developments and clinical research.\n\nA most recent example of how badly he has come to flaunt the values of science can be found in the attached material. I have included here an ad, placed personally by Professor Duesberg, announcing a public presentation of his views at the Metropolitan Community Church, a gay community facility in San Francisco. The audience is hardly the scientific community. Instead, it is aimed at enticing another generation of younger gay men- in whom new HIV infections are already running rampant- into seeing things his way. The most remarkable aspect of this is the effort he has taken to make the program look like an official program of the University of California at Berkeley, right down to the use of the University Seal. It also features his 1986 appointment to the NAS. It most certainly is not a university function. Moreover, the entire text of the ad is deceptive, disguised to look like an ad for one of the many community forums held about the new therapies, research advances, and viral load. There isn't a hint anywhere as to what the real agenda is, or how he will do his best to discourage the use of the new drugs and diagnostic measures which have given so much hope and new life to so many people. He will be there to try to convince an unwitting and otherwise uninformed audience that there is serious scientific support for his contrarian view and that all those who hold other views are somehow puppets of the pharmaceutical industry and a conspiratorial research establishment. Undoubtedly, he will succeed with some of those present, and no doubt hasten their deaths. In these days when AIDS therapy has shown such great promise, it is difficult to distinguish his actions from those of a mass murderer.\n\nI am writing to you as the chief executive of the National Academy of Sciences because Professor Duesberg is a member of your distinguished body, whose mission is to serve the public interest. His actions, I believe, are an affront to everything the NAS stands for. They mock your Academy's commitment to the scientific method and to the principle that scientists should fight their battles in a peer setting, not by public relation efforts in the public. As members of the public aggrieved by his actions, we call upon the National Academy of Sciences to raise the question of whether he is fit for continued membership in your group. I would like to propose a few possible topics for debate by the NAS:\n\n- Given a thorough review of his scientific and public behavior in the AIDS epidemic, should Peter Duesberg remain a member in good standing of the NAS?\n- Should the NAS issue a public statement, perhaps reaffirming his academic freedom, but condemning his efforts to sway the public rather than his peers?\n- Should the NAS broker a settlement with Professor Duesberg which would, minimally, prohibit him from further promotion of his potentially harmful views to the public until he presents convincing evidence to the NAS that the common view of HIV and AIDS are in error?\n\nI would like to set up a meeting between yourself and several representatives of AIDS service organizations to discuss this matter in greater detail. I will call your office to seek an appointment.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMartin Delaney Founding Director, Project Inform\n\nOrganizational Endorsements:\n\nAct-up Golden Gate, Oakland, Ca.\nAIDS Action Committee, Boston, Ma.\nAPLA/AIDS Project Los Angeles\nAIDS Research Alliance, LA\nAIDS Service Center, Pasadena, Ca.\nAIDS Treatment Initiatives, Atlanta, Ga\nBeing Alive, LA\nCenter for AIDS Prevention Studies, UCSF AIDS Research Institute\nCRIA/Community Initiative on AIDS, NYC\nCritical Path AIDS Project, Phil., PA\nDenver Buyers Club\nFAIR\nFlorida AIDS Action Council, Miami\nKraus Medical Group, LA\nMulticultural AIDS Coalition, Boston, Ma.\nProject Inform\nPWA Coalition Colorado\nResearch Sanctuary, LA\n\"Resolute: Dedicated to Surviving HIV/AIDS\", Denver\nRobert Smith Medical Group, San Diego\nSan Francisco AIDS Foundation\nTest Positive Aware Network, Chicago\nUnited foundation for AIDS, Miami\nWomen Alive, LA",

    "message": "It's about time. Here's an example of Duesberg (along with co-authors Claus Koehnlein and David Rasnick) deliberately misquoting an NEJM paper in an article they published in 2003:\n\nhttp://www.duesberg.com/papers/chemical-bases.html\n\n\"the evidence for 'declining morbidity and mortality' is only based on uncontrolled survey studies that investigated how long HIV-positive, clinically healthy subjects, but mostly from AIDS risk groups, survived on various anti-HIV drugs. The largest and most influential of these surveys was conducted by Palella et al (1998) who investigated in 1998 1255 anti-HIV drug-treated 'patients, each of which had at least one CD4+ count below 100' from nine clinics in the US. However, all of these 'patients' were 'nonhospitalized', AIDS-free subjects. 'Patients with a diagnosis of cytomegalovirus retinitis or M. aviarum complex disease before study entry or during the first 30 days of follow-up and patients with active P. carinii pneumonia at the beginning of follow-up were excluded.' A similar survey investigated in 2001 1219 anti-HIV drug-treated Canadian HIV-positives with less than 200 CD4+ cells, of which 87% were AIDS-free (Hogg et al 2001). Neither of these studies mentions drug-free controls.\"\n\nThe NEJM paper by Frank Pallela that is being misquoted focused on people with advanced illness (less than 100 CD4 T cells). The full text is available online: http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/338/13/853\n\nThe data shows the highest mortality was among people that never took antiretrovirals, the lowest among people on triple combinations (see table 1). \n\nWhat Duesberg does to try and explain away the data is pretend that the participants in the Palella study were healthy before starting antiretrovirals. This is not the case, all had <100 CD4 T cells and many had previous opportunistic infections. Duesberg et al have altered the quote from the Palella paper to make it seem like people with opportunistic infections were excluded. But this is what the quote says in the actual paper:\n\n\"Patients with a diagnosis of cytomegalovirus retinitis or M. avium complex disease before study entry or during the first 30 days of follow-up and patients with active P. carinii pneumonia at the beginning of follow-up were excluded from the analyses of the incidence of that opportunistic infection.\"\n\nIn other words, they weren't excluded from the study, they just weren't counted as having developed that particular opportunistic infection during the study, if it was pre-existing or developed during he first 30 days. Because the sentence, in its original form, is also an acknowledgement that people entered the study with a history of opportunistic infections and not just low CD4 counts - i.e. not \"asymptomatic\" or \"AIDS free\" as Duesberg is claiming - Duesberg accomplishes a double deception just by inserting a period after the word \"excluded.\" \n\nThe fact that the Palella paper reports data on people who never took antiretrovirals also contradicts Duesberg's statement that \"Neither of these studies mentions drug-free controls.\"\n\nThe late Martin Delaney of Project Inform also wrote a letter to the NAS many years ago demanding that they review Duesberg's membership; as far as I know he never received a response. I'll post a copy if I can find it. ",

Let us put an end to fissile materials, period.\n\t\nAll it will take is a little support politically and financially.\n\nWe have the technology, it is currently known technology! Developed in the 1950's and \"dropped\" on the world in a BIG way back then. It was refined by our National Labs to be done in a small way in the 1970's. Scientists said to congressional committees \"that it was the only way to go\" and and that there were \"no show stoppers\" but it went dormant from lack of funding. In the 1990's it was vetted by the scientific community in Germany, but never built due to lack of funding. It is being studied in Russia and Germany today and maybe China, but the US is silent still. It is big, no, BIG.  It produces 35GWe, bigger than utility companies have wanted to deal with, they have wanted 1.5GWe plants. Well, this can not be done that size and be economical.\n\nThis is not laser fusion, not cold fusion, nor magnetic confinement fusion ... all needing a magic material and are decades away from production, if then. It can be a base load electrical supplier, not like wind, or solar. It is large but should not impact the food supplies as would bio fuels. It does not generate carbon emissions nor highly radio-active wastes.\n\nThis is the \"Silver Bullet\" the President and the world is looking for in energy generation. It is environmentally sustainable and represents a major opportunity for businesses. It provides national energy security ... and that is not just political rhetoric!\n\nIt can cost less per kWh than fossil fuel generation.\n\nVisit www.fusionpowercorporation.com to get a basic education.\n\nLet us do this ASAP for \"Mother Earth\" our home. \nI am interested in your thoughts after you have explored the URL.\n\nHal\nhhelsley@wildblue.net\n\nnote: nuclear energy has two parts: Fission (with radio-active waste problems) and Fusion (it is BIG)\n\n\nTwelve Fascinating Little Known \nFacts about the Use of Fusion Energy \nto Generate Electricity  \n  \u2026 the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of clean green energy supplies. \n\n 1.  Fusion has no carbon emissions.  It is CLEAN - GREEN energy. It is not a finite fossil fuel. \n 2.  Fusion electricity can cost less per kW than Coal. \n 3.  Fusion\u2019s fuel supply is virtually unlimited. \n 4.  Fusion energy can be harnessed in ways that create little or NO highly radioactive waste. \n 5.  Fusion energy development will create a new industry. \n 6.  Fusion energy development will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. \n 7.  Fusion energy development can restore America\u2019s position of world leadership. \n 8.  Fusion energy sources can provide the nation with real energy security \u2026 not just political rhetoric. \n 9.  Fusion energy is supportive of nonproliferation. \n10. Use of Fusion energy can improve the global standard of living and the quality of life. \n11. Fusion energy generation can fuel the nation\u2019s and the world\u2019s economic recovery. \n12. Fusion power generation can use currently known technology - all vetted in the 1990\u2019s and be on line by 2020. \n\nBonus Facts -                  \nFusion energy does not cost too much.            \nEnergy paradigms take 30/40 years to change, that folks is 2050! \nWe must start now to meet the world\u2019s future energy needs.      \n",

This is called the singularity. This theory avoids this problem by placing the particles at different locations and different speed in the Big Bang moment. This is a good thing, but ....\n\nOne can interpret the theory that our universe is inside a black hole in a much larger universe, but also in a completely different place and in a larger scale. It seems strange to place the universe \"inside\" a wormhole, because there are not even made a reliable theoretical model of wormhole that can stay connected for 1 second without a kind form of \"exotic matter\"! How can one explain how the size of the electromagnetic forces are formed in relation to the gravity of the new universe? Instead of explaining the singularity of the Big Bang, the singularity is moved to another universe!\n\nIt's actually a new understanding of wormholes in this theory and when I think it is illogical to mix black holes into it. I see either wormhole in this context that a one-way bridge between two universes, where the entrance is the edge of the universe A and end the center of universe B. It would certainly create a balance and a regular renewal.",

    "message": "I see many of you think that blackholes are produced only from collapsed stars. This theory doesn't imply compressed stars or matter, but implies a fluctuation of the false void onto or into Higgs' Fields. The fluctuation produced a high energy density field by quantum tunneling (already observed many times; read http://www.scienceonline.org/cgi/content/full/299/5608/867) that has nothing to do with collapsed stars. On the other hand, the teleological explanation, like that found in petpetpet's post and others' posts, is the quite inappropriate for trying to elucidate the origin of the universe. Not even philosophy admits the teleological explanation. It\u2019s the same that happens with creationist assertions, if the universe, for being complex, had to be created by someone or something because nothing with such complexity can appear from nothing, then intrinsically that someone or something had forcibly to have been created by someone or something more complex\u2026 and etcetera. Concluding, this theory doesn\u2019t contemplate blackholes created from collapsed stars, but by fluctuations of the false void which exerts a negative pressure over matter and energy. These are real systems which can be checked out in any suitable particle accelerator (cyclotron). The same process we apply in a cyclotron took place 13.8 billion years ago in a region of space in a mother-universe. Regarding the origin of the first mother-universe, I only am allowed to tell you that the space and time are not \u201cthings\u201d created from nothingness.",

What you commented about the thought dimension sounds something along the lines of Rupert Sheldrake's Morphic Resonance idea; which I find compelling and connects such notions as the mind body dichotomy. Go leftfield from there and check out Sheldrake, Terence McKenna, and a mathematical theorist (the duderinok, U tube) who found that each of their ideas were coming together concerning theoretical, practical, and scientific synergies about matter, energy and mind. Hope that helps. Chunkification.  ",

That is what is different about our experiment - the Rossby number and basic instability mechanism in the experiment are plausible for conditions on Saturn, unlike the Danish experiments which merely reproduced polygonal patterns. We make no claim to be the first to produce polygons in fluids - there are plenty of examples in the literature already going back more than 20 years. What is different here is plausible dynamical similarity with Saturn (albeit only partial) - which we suggest is certainly not 'bad science'!",

Or is it more likely our purpose is to achieve a complete understanding of how everything in the universe works?\r\n\r\nClearly I would choose the latter if I can. Once again, I would like to emphasize that, I chose that because I THINK we human being should trace our origin or we will just be the same as those wild animals and I don't want to be like that. This is only my choice. I am not saying that I am right. Of course we can also simply ignore those physical laws lying beyond our world and make a good living. But here comes the question which always annoys me. What is the meaning of surviving peacefully on this small planet? What is the meaning of such existence of ecosystem where we human beings exist? What is the meaning of continuing our species as long as we can though we will finally die when our Sun becomes a red giant which is expected to engulf our planet as expected by our knowledge of stars? When I think of these questions, I don't think making our living on this planet safely and peacefully has any meaning. That's why I chose the latter. (Though I admit that we NEED those people who care only our planet since without them, I probably can't live well.)\r\n\r\nIndeed, what do you mean by the simplest solution? Do you think that managing our planet is simpler than pursuiting the truth? Somebody may find it easier to deal with physics and mathematics than deal with people in the society. Somebody may find it easier to be a scientist than be a politician. There is no criteria about what is simple and what is not, I think.",

I am graduating this semester with a degree in structural engineering, so my math and science skills are above average. Yet, would I be classified as \"scientifically illiterate\" by this survey? My suggestion, come up with a new question. \nBTW, you all talking about explosions. From my knowledge of explosives, an explosion is defined as a rapid expansion of gas that exceeds the speed of sound in the surrounding medium. If the shock wave does not exceed the speed of sound, then it's a conflagration. ",

For example, a gigantic region in space that is sucking out our universe, the pulling effects of negative pressure upon all matter in the universe which is out of our sight, etc. These and many other observable phenomena and processes in the known universe originates some clues for modeling a plausible explanation (theory) to the whole set of findings. That's the way we construct science, not the opposite way. For example, Poplawski is trying to explain by his hypothesis some of those latest discoveries.",

    "message": "\u201cThere can be no fundamental particles.\u201d \r\n\r\nScientist play the most important role in our existence as a species. However they are looking down the wrong side of the telescope when they search for things that don\u2019t exist. Everything has to be made of something. Not even nothingness can be made of nothing. That's why we observe subatomic particles popping in and out of existence in the vacuum of space. Did you know that the vacuum has infinite density. The concept of nothingness is simply a concept and cannot exist. Ask yourself this question, In M or String Theory what are these strings made of? Every time an answer is found ask the question again. The answer can NEVER be nothing. The deeper we look we will always find something there based on the ability and technologies of the observer. We live in an infinite universe that is infinitely big and infinitely small. There can be no fundamental particles. We are the atomic makeup of a larger structure. It may vary well be a life form. Pure speculation of course but I hope this could open your mind and think outside this Matrix.\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - \r\n\r\nTime is a fundamental dimension. It is the only dimension that is entangled with all other dimensions because it is relative to all dimensions and affects them the same. Also this is contradiction to my earlier point.\r\n \r\nI define time simply as a dimension that allows cause and effect to evolve. Time affect all objects the same from their relative point of view. Time is relative to your personal boundary of equilibrium, your *event horizon. Picture this, when we look up in the sky and see a galaxy, we see it almost like a two dimensional photo. Its not moving and it just sits there. However that is an illusion. The galaxy is in a transient state. From the point of view of the galaxy, it spins just like water flowing down a drain in real time. Time affect all parties the same even the atomic. We see time different from our galaxy because it takes us about 200 million years to make a complete orbit. The same orbit  may be like a second from the point of view of the Milky Way. This is due to time compression, relative size and conscious frequency. Perception of time is relative, like the conscious differences between humans and humming birds or flies. That why its so hard to catch a fly because it sees time differently relative to you. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s almost like we are swimming in a sea of time rather than space. If something has any dimension it has to exist in the dimension of time. Everything is evolving vibrations of energies. To evolve it needs the dimension of time to allow cause and effect to take order. Time is the one dimension that is entangled with all other dimensions. Almost as if time was fundamental to everything. \r\n\r\nTime is primary to space in Space-Time. I even began calling it Time-Space. Here\u2019s why. Time gives things order and 3 dimensional space is like a blank canvas for cause and effect move around. (If Tim-Space was a particle, time would be the nucleus and space would be the outer shell.)\r\n\r\n If I drop a baseball, the ball must follow a logical order of decent. It cant leave my hand appear two inches off the ground, then seven inches up, then six inches down then hit the floor. It has to follow a natural evolutionary path and time is the main dimension which permits this. From superposition, the greater of the odds collapses to one possibility and follows the logical path of order. That\u2019s why time flows forward. It is the most efficient way energy can evolve over space. More so, nature can only do things in the most efficient way. That\u2019s why grass does not strain to grow and why light is our event horizon and our speed limit defining our natural boundaries. Nature must choose the path of least resistance. Then my mind began to wonder why would nature use a force as weak as gravity to sculpt the cosmos especially when it needs all this imaginary Dark matter to work. *Plasma is responsible for 99.999% of the visible universe. It is highly conductive and since everything is made out of energy wouldn\u2019t nature use it\u2019s most abundant resource to sculpt the universe. \r\n\r\nIf you are trying to solve a problem it is wise to look to nature first and see how deals with the problem. For example if we want to travel among the stars we might try to figure out how to make a filed of some sort around a star ship to make it appear massless to the rest of the universe. But you may run into problems if you want to return to Earth in the same time era as you left. Time on Earth will move faster than relative time on your star ship the closer you get to the speed of light and you may return 300 years in Earth's future.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n(*Nassim Haramein,*Plasma Cosmology and Thunderbolts of the Gods)\r\n",

    "message": "The simple answer is usually right. Using a force as weak as gravity as the base of the Standard Model, especially when you have to create fictional matter just to make it work should raise serious questions about its\u2019 validity. Every other prediction made thereafter with this assumption should continue to run into dead ends as cosmologist will continue to make patches to save this flawed theory of our Standard Model. \r\n\r\nA patch is an invention not based in any evidence or observation. It is used to hide flaws in an equation. Patches like the Neutron star when we began observing pulsars spinning about 300 times a second. A star or any mass of that size cannot spin that fast because they will fly apart. Hence the invention of the Neutron Star. But you can\u2019t pack neutrons so close together. This violates the Island of Stability principle in nuclear chemistry. You can\u2019t just break establish laws of other sciences and remove cause from effect. *A pulsar is not a super fast spinning star but binary stars pulsating electrically through plasma\r\n\r\nEven the Red shift ruler has flaws. (Look this up on Youtube: Galaxy NGC-7603) If the Standard Model is correct and Red Shifts does define speed and distance then this galaxy cannot exist. We observed two bodies with different red shifts connected by plasma. These objects are supposed to be millions of light years apart due to their different red shift. How can these two galaxies be connected by a plasma trail? Also please don\u2019t insult my intelligence and say this is a chance alignment. We can\u2019t have it both ways. It\u2019s either the theory is right and something is wrong with our telescopes or the observation tells us the we HAVE to start over and realize we know nothing at all. For example, Why can\u2019t we fuse energy like the sun which allegedly does this everyday? Why can\u2019t we send quantum information back in time because the nervous system does this everyday. Why can\u2019t we travel as fast as the sun,  at about  447,000 miles per hour. Why can\u2019t we change iron into gold? The sun allegedly creates metals everyday. (All we have to do is add or remove the right amount of protons and neutrons.) My point is we are a young civilization and we shouldn\u2019t be thumping or chest with theories of everything especially when they left out allegedly 95% of the universe in M-Theory? We don\u2019t know what this Dark Matter and Dark Energy is. I don\u2019t believe in Santa Clause and I don\u2019t believe in things we can\u2019t detect. \r\n\r\n\r\n So this fundamental question remain unanswered, is the universe expanding because we can\u2019t use the red shift ruler with certainty. If it is not expanding did the big bang ever happen? Understand we assume there was a big bang only because we think the galaxies are moving away from each other. There is no evidence for a big bang other than the microwave background and that is still debatable. Consider the logic of this theory. If you walked out of an alley and see two cars driving away from each other in opposite directions will you automatically assume that they exploded into existence from a single point and was created out of nothingness. When the basis of a theory is flawed every prediction it makes thereafter will be flawed. \r\n\r\nI know they will call it blasphemy when I say Tesla had it right and Einstein had it wrong. I never understood how these theoretical maths could describe new things we haven\u2019t observed. We can use math to measure mass and distance and time but everything there after is pure speculation. What I am saying is pure speculation. I believe it is impossible for the universe not to be filled with life and I can\u2019t prove it. \u201cLogic is king in the land of the unknowns.\u201d  Maxwell Crone\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are no fundamental particles.\u201d Read more\u2026 http://www.facebook.com/note.php?saved&&suggest&note_id=385863931623#!/note.php?note_id=385863931623\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n\r\n*Plasma Cosmology and Thunderbolts of The Gods\r\n",

    "message": "Is it possible for a universe to be at the center of a black hole?\n\nA black hole is not a hole at all.  It\u2019s relatively spherical.  A sphere that is 3,000 times the mass of our sun but only 10 times the diameter sits at the center of our Milky Way galaxy.  It powers the galaxy the way our sun powers our solar system, just on a much larger scale.  When I began to think of a Black Hole as a sphere and not some kind of drain that matter falls into, I started to see things differently.  Matter was pulled into the center of a sphere, from all directions at once.  The singularity could be thought of as the core of the black hole.  \n\nI began to think of a black hole as a type of star.  What happens to a super massive star?  It\u2019s life ends because gravity wins out.  The core collapses into a black hole.  Black holes grow by consuming gas and dust.  They also grow by  merging with other black holes.  It would make sense then to believe the core of the black hole would also grow.  What would happen to the black hole when and if gravity wins?  What would happen if the core of the black hole collapsed?  \n\nIs it possible that the energy released when the core of a black hole collapses ignites the birth of a new universe?  And that universe exists inside the mother black hole which itself exists in it\u2019s own universe.  When the core collapses a big bang occurs.  A massive sun is destroyed after a supernova.  I believe a black hole survives its supernova.  The new universe will exist and expand from within the mother black hole.  I believe that energy from the baby universe radiates back into the mother universe by means of Hawking radiation.  Hawking radiation might even answer the question of the expanding universe.  Our universe is expanding at an ever increasing rate.  Hawking radiation may be pulling our universe apart.  \n\nA growing singularity within a super massive black hole seems to me very similar to the description of the first moments of our universe.  A perfect medium of infinite mass.  Matter stripped down to it\u2019s most basic elements.  I believe these are one and the same. \n\nAt the instant the core collapses a big bang occurs.  The explosion instantly creates a bubble within the mother black hole.  This bubble could be Guth\u2019s inflationary theory.   \n\nDark matter may be the outer regions of the mother black hole that completely surrounds the baby universe.  A shell of black hole would have a powerful gravitational pull of its own pulling the baby universe apart.  The baby universe grows within the mother black hole until it has matured and eventually dies.\n\nDark energy may be the current created by Hawking radiation leaking back into the mother universe.  A universe dying and a black hole evaporating back into space are the same thing, I believe. \n",

    "message": "Dear Ryan... Something is wrong in your assertion. Our universe was not formed into a wormhole, neither between two other dimensions of between other universes. Our universe was formed from another mother-universe into a false void bubble at the ending extreme of a wormhole. We now are sliding down on the hill of the Higgs\u2019 fields towards the true emptiness region. We do not know what will happen when we arrive at that extreme energy state; nevertheless, it is so distant in the future, that it doesn\u2019t worry to me. In addition, a possibility exists that our universe befalls into an oscillating system fluctuating between high energy density state and almost null energy density state. It would be as something bouncing infinitely in time. However, with the caveat, the entropy would be never negative, which would imply that our universe would give birth to other universes and ours would be a mother-universe. :)",

Debating the details of evolutionary history is something that scientists are expected to do.  Refusing to accept the sh1tload of evidence that man is descended from other apes, monkeys, prosimians, rodents, fish, etc. in a relatively well known sequence is, of course, irrational b.s.  And to refuse to consider the evidence because the conclusion contradicts the lies told by your bronze-aged religion, is willful ignorance.  If people refuse to admit that the world is round, over 6000 years old, and goes around the sun, then they are liars.  If they believe their own lies, then they are psychopathic liars.  End of story.\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to convert people to rational thought, we should just make a new global law.  Any person or society that refuses to acknowledge the correctness of science is not allowed to partake in the benefits of science including nuclear weapons, radar evading technology, electricity, powered flight, and explosives (including gunpowder). \r\n",

This seems to have mostly to do with the formation and or modeling of proteins which are a component of all living things but which by themselves are not life. I am not a biologist, biochemist or anything close so I am out of my field on this. I guess I brought it up but it seems off subject anyway.",

    "message": "Actually Joe, I think I do understand it quite well. Your quote of \"theories can incorporate facts and laws and tested hypotheses\" mentions only tested hypothesis. Without at least one tested hypothesis you do not have a theory. Darwin's hypothesis attempts to extrapolate observations of the natural world as we see it today all the way back in time to the point where there was no life in a world that no one has ever seen much less left a record of. People have attempted and failed to recreate this so called primordial soup condition and attempted to coax life from lifelessness using all kinds of external stimuli that were seen as plausible to exist. This is the basic brick in the hypothesis, and until you can devise an experiment to show reliably and repeatedly by any research facility that life can be caused to occur from lifelessness in some probable scenario, then all you have is a untested hypotheses. Also, to counter your claim that gravity is a theory, I say that gravity is a natural condition that exists whether you understand it or not. If there was a valid theory of gravity then you should be able to manipulate it. Let us all know when you have come up with an anti-gravity device. It will make you rich beyond the wildest dreams of avarice. By the way, I am a practicing Electronics Engineer so I have a pretty good grasp of things that would have been called \"magic\" only a couple of decades ago. The following link describes the scientific method. Among other things it supports my contention that a tested (proven true) hypothesis precedes an idea being advanced to the status of being a theory. http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_scientific_method.shtml\n\n\n",

    "message": "I am unfamiliar with the cited paradox. However, in general, when people start trying to use mathematics to \"prove\" that something must exist simply because the odds in favor of it are astronomical then I get pretty skeptical. In this case, consider the bombardier beetle. It manufactures two chemicals within its body that explode on contact. It uses these chemicals to spray boiling hot liquid on anything that may attack it with spray nozzles that it can point in almost any direction. Why doesn't the beetle explode itself when these chemicals mix? Why doesn't the beetle get burned by the boiling hot liquid? Everything about the bombardier flies in the face of Darwin's hypothesis. Every part of the bombardier beetle used in this deadly defense mechanism including its explosion proff mixing chamber and its heat resistant makeup HAD to come together all at once. Otherwise the beetle would have blown himself up the first time it mixed those chemicals. Not very likely to get itself very far along an \"evolutionary\" path if it blows up every time a predator attacks. What do you suppose the odds of all those parts evolving at once are? One scientist who studies those beetles figured the odds were astronomical against it. He went from being a Darwinist to a creationist as his studies of the Bombardier continued. The Bible says that the evidence of the creator are within the things created. The house you build to live in is evidence of a builder. Things simply do not happen by themselves. Otherwise we would be fond of saying things like \"Isn't it wonderful that that car just created itself out of nothing just in time for you to start using it?\"",

When you take existing life and manipulate it to create a copy or a hybrid all you are establishing is that that existing life-forms can be modified by external stimuli. Not too different from what can be done accidentally with various mutagenic chemicals. You can call it what you want, but I call it adaptation. A simple example can be seen in the faces of abalone divers. Due to the constant exposure to cold water, their body responds by adding a lot of blood vessels especially in the epidermis giving them a very ruddy complexion. Repeated long enough , the offspring of these hardy individuals would likely be born that way. Voila! a new sub-species. Still the ability to add blood vessels in response to repeated exposure to cold water was intrinsic all along. So really no evolution or permanent change occurs.",

When the author of Science\u2019s article refers to a \u201cDeep Throat\u201d, he\u2019s not referring to a plastic funnel or something of the kind possessing invisible walls or shields, but to different fields occurring all over an energy density gradient which is ephemeral and prevents the formation of nuclei (matter as we know it).

    "message": "Astrophysicists  must eventually come to terms with the fact that the Big Bang does not make sense.  Really now, there was a singularity, meaning what, a one of a kind thing? and then suddenly it just exploded?  what caused it to explode? was pressure building up inside it? does that mean there was a time before the big bang, during which pressure built up? And to say our universe comes from another universe, well, that's something of a cop out, because isn't the universe supposed to encompass everything?\r\nNow, you don't have to let go of it yet, because evidently the Big Bang theory still has plenty of legs on it.  It's the most comprehensive  (though far from complete) explanation they've come up with so far (oh excuse me except for the explanation involving the giant bearded man in the white robe who lives in the sky and declared everything into existence) and is stimulating additional thinking.  But eventually you'll have to move on.  We need a better explanation.  It's probably obvious that I am not a professional scientist, but here's what I think:  the Big Bang is like the concept of a Point in geometry.  It doesn't really exist, but by postulating that it does exist, we've come up with a lot of useful ideas that help to explain and measure reality.  So keep at it, but don't get to enamored of it, because eventually that theory is going down!",

Perhaps before the creation of the universe all was pure energy which in some unknown way for unknown reasons started to knit itself into subatomic particles which then formed atoms and molecules in a high energy plasma and on up the hierarchy to you and me. The first matter need not have exploded into empty space.  It could as easily have stared simply, pop, and with growing purpose organized outward from there like an ice crystal growing in a pond until all is solid.  It may have commenced universally; not at a single point, Let There be Light style, the ancient\u2019s only metaphor for energy particles. The creation process is said to be accelerating outward but a better word would be snowballing and 3D, assembling outward faster and faster, or so it appears from our point our view.  As for time, once there is matter there is gravity and the clock starts running, in that we can look backwards through history, geological time, and even to light traveling since the beginning to give us a sense of the passage of time.  But it is really no more than the history of creation, an illusion, not its present state.  Now. That changes continually although tomorrow never comes.  ",

    "message": "Just because man does not understand gravity doesn't mean it doesn't make sense. Keep at it boys you may \"get it\" someday. What doesn't make any sense is the big bang theory. It proposes to explain the origin of the universe by positing a preexisting \"singularity\", itself a preposterous notion. Surely, you have to ask where did this supposed singularity come from. In fact, if you keep asking where did that come from, you eventually arrive at an act of creation by something that always existed. Call it what you want, eventually all those cryptic mathematical notations come to naught. Also, as I understand the concept of the \"scientific method\" the \"Big Bang Theory\" should be called the \"Big Band Hypothesis\" because there is no way to test it empirically with some human devised experiment. Same goes for the \"Theory of Evolution\" which should be called \"Darwin's Hypothesis\" or something similar. No one has yet devised an experiment to test any of it's tenets that has ever yielded fruitage. Everything observed in nature is really only evidence that most , if not all, species have within them the ability to adapt to new circumstances which may result in them looking a little different.",

Evolution and the Big Bang are complex, layered theories and to get a solid handle on them takes time, energy and patience.  It's much easier to visualize some old guy with a long beard snapping his fingers to create the world, leaving a few extra brain cycles for NASCAR, church and \"American Idol.\"  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately holding these ignorant beliefs causes the believer to reject other bit of broadly expert-accepted science like vaccinations and climate change, which leaves everyone at greater risk.  These beliefs *are* dangerous and they do real harm.

The sheer scale of this kind of transgression against the common good, which places the economic gain of these few individuals ahead of the well being and possibly the survival of the entire economy in which they operate, requires a new name:  Econocide. \r\n \r\nAnd when these individuals are finally forced by regulation or the disastrous consequences of their irresponsible actions to make the switch, they will inevitably attempt to use their political power, as evidenced by recent bailouts in the financial  and automotive sectors, to ensure the public purse and society at large picks up the tab for the situation and crisis which they created in the first place.

    "message": "I believe we are building the house much bigger than it needs to be.  Too many rooms that's not a part of the original foundation. The network ought to be simple. Electromagnetism and the week nuclear force has already been unified. Dark energy is an aspect of space/time with  0 energy. How? IT is not an energy.  It's an aspect. Now you will have to redo your math. Now, dark matter,on the other hand, for it to exist, it would have to have some kind of buoyancy pressure to keep it from collecting in massive solids. Since the earth still weights the same, dark energy has not collapsed. Now, if buoyant (as many believe and HST has taken pictures of  vast hydrogen clouds connecting galaxies \"proving\" dark matter) it just would not work. Imagine you tunneling through earth. the deeper you go, the lighter you get. That is because the deeper you go, you have more earth all around you instead of under you. This action could not keep a galaxy together. I Believe dark matter can be explained away with 3 points. (1)...the mass of super massive black holes have been seriously under estimated. The observed rotation curve at the outer edge of the galaxy can be explained by a \"beefed up\" super massive black hole.  The center rotation curve can also be explained as space/time is being dragged around. That is,from our vantage point,we see stars near the center going slower than they are from there own vantage point thus matching the rotational curve of the outer rim. This time dilation makes it difficult to weight mass especially if you omit it. (2)...Every globular cluster has an intermediate mass black hole. Also, stellar mass black holes are probably more common than thought, Our galaxy is at least 8 billion yrs old, A lot of star evolution for massive stars, think about it. If a stellar mass black was not \"feeding\" or part of a binary system, it would go undetected. Now in (2) we have most but not all of the mass we need. (1) we have a little relativity and extra mass, now (3) Gravity propagates at the speed of light. If the sun would disappear altogether, it would take about 8 min.before we see it disappear and at the same moment earth would stray from it's orbit. Now, with that in mind, consider a star say 30,000 Lt yrs away in the arm preceding the sun around the galaxy. The sun is now  feeling the gravity of that star at a point where it was 30,000 yrs ago.The star is not there now. It has moved farther around the galaxy during that time with a weaker pull of gravity following the inverse square law.  In other words, each star in an arm of a galaxy feels a \"phantom\" pull of the preceding star more than giving the preceding star a gravitational drag. This effect is small but should not be omitted. Pennies makes dollars. Now, why do we need worm holes to explain dark energy and dark matter? Calculus can not tell you what happens inside a black hole or a worm hole (or if it exist) because it is based on theory. Respectfully, I think we should consider what went over our heads first before adding more rooms to the house than we need. By the way, If the Higgs Boson is discovered, it might be found to give mass to quarks via gravatons which might be indistinguishable from the strong nuclear force at higher energies.\nI am not a scientist,but this makes since to me. I have the up most respect for all you guys out there.You might even be right.",

    "message": "I actually agree, it's not just knowing what scientists think. But we're still not talking about the same thing, I fear, so let me try a different approach.\n\nIn Chapter 7 of the Science and Engineering Indicators 2008 (http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind08/front/about.htm): \"Scientific literacy is the capacity to use scientific knowledge, to identify questions and to draw evidence-based conclusions in order to understand and help make decisions about the natural world and the changes made to it through human activity.\"\n\nI maintain a person can do the above without *accepting* the theory or denouncing all others. I'm not saying this is common, but nevertheless I see no reason why a person couldn't be a proponent of Creation, and yet have formal mastery of the principles of Evolution. Such a person would have the ability to use scientific knowledge to draw evidence based conclusions about Evolution, and yet for whatever reason may decide to make decisions about the natural world based on Creation.\n\nOr using your question of gravity as an example:\n\n\"Gravity is the result of the warping of space-time by mass where bodies follow the shortest path as dictated by this curvature.\" What about \"gravity is a force mediated by a massless (and hypothetical!) elementary particle with spin-2?\"  Does your question about relativity require me to categorically denounce the existence of a graviton? If it does then maybe I'll answer \"no\" because (as far as I know, and admittedly I don't know much) this is still an open question. Oh wait, was the intent of your question simply to confirm I knew relativity is one theory about gravity? Then say so: \"General relativity explains gravity as the result of the warping of space-time...\" and I'll answer \"yes\".\n\n",

Further, there are models that support the notion/theory of stable wormholes created at the formation of the universe - see John G. Cramer, Robert L. Forward, Michael S. Morris, Matt Visser, Gregory Benford, and Geoffrey A. Landis, \"Natural Wormholes as Gravitational Lenses,\" Phys. Rev.

Physics assumes the vacuum is isotropic (deeply validated by photons and conservation of angular momentum).

Let us destabilize physics with a test founded in geometry not composition:\r\n\r\nDo opposite shoes violate the Equivalence Principle?\r\n\r\nActual shoes are silly.  We need two physically and chemically identical solid single crystal spheres whose contained atoms' positions are perfect mirror images in all directions and are maximally non-superposable.  Crystallography offers two candidates:  Paired enantiomorphic space groups P3(1)21 / P3(2)21 and enantiomorphic space groups P3(1) / P3(2) are extreme cases within the 230 space group possibilties.

    "message": "@Wheelkick -- its not a matter of liberal vs. conservative interpretation, it is a matter of holding onto and perpetuating beliefs that are so easily debunked.  I also suggest you check your sources on which faiths are the big losers nowadays.  Virtually all surveys (like the Pew Forum) who question people under 30 about their religious convictions, find that the biggest losers are the evangelicals and mainstream protestant groups alike.  Moreover, the one group that is truly growing by leaps and bounds are not evangelicals, as you chose to believe, or even Christians as a whole, but those who lack any strong bond with religion whatsoever.  It seems your Evangelism, rather than spreading the Gospel, is driving people away from the faith altogether, and doing it with gusto.  I am glad to hear that in your provincial neck of the woods your faith is doing blockbuster business, but all national polls really indicate that modern Christian Evangelism is the best tool the Devil ever created for destroying faith in Jesus.  You and the current cadre of evangelicals may be able to continually deny obvious scientific facts for the remainder of your lives without much consequence, but young people are voting with their feet -- they are clearly not buying your brand of faith anymore -- and this result I am sure will weigh heavily against you come the day of your own Judgment.  But, by all means, feel free to continue claiming that black is white, as you do in your post here and as you do within your own sense of faith, because your arrogant and obstinate attitude continually proves to those of us, who have long prayed for the demise of Christian Evangelism, that we are indeed having our prayers answered with every passing day.

Einstein believed in Scientific Design and lived through the era of arguing creationism vs evolution originally anti-materialism and materialism. The anti-materialism was so evident creationist was used to change the subject in late 19 century so the Child Fairy Tale was used to indicate only a child would believe in creationism and it worked even to news casters.  The term  politically correct, was changed or created. Einstein said stupidity and genius are alike except genius has its limit. Any real Life Scientist  knows who Einstein was referring to. Time and new discoveries  has possibly  proved Einstein wrong because total in math is a limit and the 18% remaining  is very near a total. Remember AAAS,NFS, and NSF have been in charge of  science for 150 years promoting Darwin's Tree as Life Science or actually as a cult religion . They even created microevolution and macroevolution so evolve could be used to avoid giving a reason for their existance other than it was an accident. I am not using the very strong term stupid but will leave that up to Einstein, and  the following great scientists among many other scientific creationists believed in Intelligent Design. Astronomy: Galileo, Herschel, Maunder, Kepler, Biology: Ray, Linnaeus, Mendel, Pasteur, Chemistry: Boyle, Dalton, Pascal, Ramsay, Geology: Steno, Woodward, Brewster, Agassi, Physics: Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, Kelvin.  evolutionist need to recognize Genetics DNA is based on a code system  like 3% codes to protein production and the other is not Junk DNA as evolutionist imply or even state.

Most of us call that supernatural or a phenomenon. Most explain that it is a time warp. Why can't it be a new dimension? Why does it have to be a malfunction of time? Why does the word \"time\" have to be mentioned at all. There has always been many collisions throughout the infinite existence of space. Asteroids and planetary bodies collide all the time, not only once! So, as far as my understanding of the universe, there is no single \"big bang\" that caused our existence. If we want to mention big bangs, we should include the other big bangs that continue to happen in space, even as we speak, and those that have occurred long ago. We should consider the other big bangs or planetary collision that have occurred before the so-called ultimate big bang that scientist have theorized. There is also an infinite number of universes out there in space. And they were not created either; they were just there. We do not have the capacity to comprehend the dimension that could be used to accurately describe their existence. So, we should indeed leave it that. We will never know or understand everything, we can only do our best to understand our world. In fact, we have done pretty well with our limited resources of science and mathematics.",

    "message": "Lee Smolin first put forward this idea many years ago, and excellently expanded upon by Quentin Smith, called \"fecund universe\" theory. The idea is that a star in another \"parent\" universe collapsed and created a black hole, where our universe exists around the edge of the disk of the infinitely spiralling and expanding black hole's singularity point. Many black hole's in our universe would potentially have other \"baby\" universe's at their singularity points, and so on. It would be evolution on the grandest of scales, as universes seed themselves with stars with the ability to propagate more universe's, constantly refining themselves toward the right state of elements and conditions for this to occur. This theory is more appealing to me than our universe's existence inside of a wormhole.",

If we just let it be, without thinking about where we are from, and how our home, the universe, was formed (or started), and just live and reproduce so as to let our next generation to continue our species, then what is the difference between us and the wild animals? In Chinese, there is a statement saying that \"Think about where the water came from before we drink it.\" Now we exist in this universe and we are enjoying everything in it. If we don't ask ourselves \"why we can enjoy these wonderful things?\", it would simply mean that we have no difference from other animals. Ability of thinking in a mathematical logic way and exploring the world in a science logic way makes us human. Even though we may not be able to reach the so-called ultimate truth, moving toward it with our own limited mathematical and scientific methods is the ONLY meaning of our existence. Of course, there is no such thing like right or wrong. We can all choose our way of living. We can also choose to be an ordinary animal. But I don't want to be like that. I have my choice.",

There was never a starting point for the universe or the universe before that. We humans should accept the fact that we don not have the ability to comprehend the ultimate time that our universe or other universes began.   We are always trying to put time on everything--Oh this happened such amount of years ago, that happened this amount of years ago. The universe is timeless, which means that it was never created, and it will never end because it was started; it was just in existence. We need another measuring system other than time to measure the existence of the universe. And we are human without the capacity to comprehend that other timeless dimension, so I think we should quit trying to explain the existence of the universe in terms of the big bang theory. We can't even accurately measure it with mathematics or science. This is telling us that it is out of our human league of understanding, and we should just let it be as it is... ",

I can't help but think that willful ignorance is still ignorance. Even if the questions were couched with \"According to scientists..., \" we learn only that people know *of* these theories. Should being able to identify oversimplified ideas with what they're called qualify as \"knowing\" what those theories are?\n\nIf I may opine for a moment, people that have a more than superficial understanding of the two theories in question are much more likely to recognize them as factual. (Another opinion:) This is not merely a matter of having a pet belief and learning more about it but rather that understanding the facts supporting our beleaguered theories makes direct refutation awkward at best. If these opinions have merit we might conclude that a the belief component that causes those polled to choose \"false\" is an indicator of true ignorance, willful or not. To take it a step further, the poll illustrates that the teaching of these principles and their supporting facts have not been, and perhaps are not being, adequately presented in the general curriculum.

If any such thing is found, then many fundamental results of relativity (which is the only theory that tells us anything about black holes anyway) is thrown into chaos.\n\nSecondly, nothing is spewed 'from the top and bottom' of a black hole. High energy matter in the accretion disk surrounding a black hole can be ejected outwards in jets and accelerated by magnetic fields, but certainly not from inside. Tiny black holes can emit thermal radiation, but the microwave background means this can never lead to a net emission for any black hole more than a tenth of a millimetre across.\n\nAnd white holes... haven't a clue what you're on about. What goes in, stays in. If you throw a billion tons into a black hole, you get a black hole that's a billion tons heavier, and it doesn't come out again. Don't know what you've been reading (or smoking) there, Meiliken... but it does sound fun.",

Just another example of priestly classes attempting to control what is considered truth in the minds of the dumb masses.\n\n********************\n\nThe Galileo affair was a sequence of events, beginning around 1610, during which Galileo Galilei came into conflict with the Catholic Church over his support of Copernican astronomy.[1]\n\nIn 1610, Galileo published his Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new telescope. These and other discoveries exposed major difficulties with the understanding of the heavens that had been held since antiquity, and raised new interest in radical teachings such as the heliocentric theory of Copernicus (published in De revolutionibus orbium coelestium in 1543).\n\nIn reaction, many scholars attacked the theory because it seemingly contradicted several passages of Scripture. Galileo's part in the controversies over theology, astronomy, and philosophy culminated in his trial and sentencing in 1633 on a grave suspicion of heresy.",

When a physical tenet is largely accepted, it is referred to as a \"law\", an unfortunate and rather arrogant term used largely due to historical reasons. But this also makes it annoyingly difficult when it comes to explaining what is meant by \"theory\" of evolution- which is biologically equivalent to a physical law, but sounds weaker just by virtue of how the word is misinterpreted.",

Of course the GPS unit must use data from several satellites to calculate a position.\n\nThere are ways of interpolating position, I use one in my work which has three laser ring gyros, three accelerometers, and lots of programming.  I can get a precise positon at 20 Hz (and attitude at 200 Hz) but it's big and very expensive.

    "message": "\"The universe began with a big explosion\" is a terrible statement for the scientifically literate, as far as I am concerned.  Do I agree with the Big Bang theory?  Well, I'd say it's the best theory available that fits the evidence, but would I say it was necessarily a big explosion, like somebody set off a bunch of firecrackers?  Eh, not so much.  The \"explosion\" was a literal outward progression of matter from an originally highly-condensed state, but I can see where one might consider that differently from an \"explosion\" of bomb variety.\r\n\r\nThat being said, there's really no excuse on the evolution front.  The fundamentals of science make it clear what constitutes a valid hypothesis, and there's no experimental (much less rigorously examined and reproducible) evidence for \"Intelligent Design\"/Creationism.  If you want to believe something or someone set off the Big Bang, well, nobody can disprove you, but it's pretty clear that humanity has physically changed over the past six thousand years alone, much less over the time span before that.  Disagreeing that humanity has been around for more than six thousand years indicates a lack of scientific literacy as well, given the dating methods we have available.  Disagreeing with the accuracy of radioactive isotope dating is basically equivalent to saying the scientific method as we know it just made up whatever it felt like.",

At this point evolution as a general explanation for how life changes and adapts is essentially irrefutable. Aside from all the fossilized evidence (where are the dinosaurs in the bible?), experiments with fruit flies, observing adaptation in the wild, decoding the genome, etc... we're now also able to use the principles of evolution to solve highly non-linear optimization problems that have nothing to do with living things. In short, evolution works both as a process and a general explanation for how life changes and adapts.

In fact, most seem to me to have little interest in theological questions..  However, most seem to accept the miraculous power of prayer, and if one accepts that God acts miraculously daily in our affairs it is difficult to believe he could have left the process of evolution to go untended.   It seems to me that scientists who accept the possibility of such 'gentle' interference in evolution should be considered acceptable in evolutionary research,  on the same grounds that scientists who believe in the power of prayer are not generally considered  unacceptable   in fields such as physics and engineering,  Miraculous divine interference in evolution seems to me no more unacceptable than divine interference in the operation of Newton's laws.",

God is bigger and more powerful than we can imagine. \n\nHe is obviously bigger and more wondrous than many fundamental Christian can handle. God ( and our entire world view) is not what it was 200 years ago. God gave us the power to be smart, to reason, to observe His universe and to learn and be in awe. Not to be afraid of what he has given us. \n\nThe evidence we see ( and God has given us the power to see this) is that he got us here through evolution. This reminds me that years ago many christians believed the world was flat and that the sun could not have sun spots. Realizing the earth is not flat, and realizing the sun has spots, has not meant christianity is doomed. It has meant that the universe God dealt us is more wondrous and amazing than we could imagine, if not for science. \n\nHow on earth did faith ever get so caught up trying to deny science. It is not healthy. Would God want good Christians to deny what science has let us see and let us use? I don't think so. \n\n\n",

    "message": "Damn.  Only 45% of U.S. Americans in 2008 believed humans evolved from earlier species?!!!??  It's really that low?  There really is only one thing to do, and that is hope, in the name of all that is good, that aliens actually exist and come to earth and remove the theists from the planet.\n\nHow can one look at the evolution of human cults (they're all cults), from belief in things such as sky and water \"gods\", through animism and polytheism and on to monotheism, and not see the obvious inverse relationship between knowledge and religious ridiculousness, and not have the capacity to rise above it?\n\nIt is painfully obvious that they believe what they do because they are (1) afraid of death and unwilling to face their fear, (2) unable to cope with a trauma or life difficulties and need a psychological crutch, and unwilling to grow, or (3) too stupid to realize they've been brainwashed.  And these people vote.  It is truly frightening to know they walk among us.  They are a liability.  They are a disease.\n\nOh, and John Bruer seems correct, at least about the Big Bang question.  I would like to see it rephrased as \"The universe most likely began with what astronomers call the 'Big Bang' \".  It's the most agreed-upon theory, but it seems still too tenuous compared to things like star system evolution, or biological evolution, both of which we can observe and study with direct evidence.  I agree with others here that the \"explosion\" nature of it is a bit speculative, or a poor term.\n\nAnd Ezra, the idea that the Big Bang theory could be \"esoteric\" to anyone, whether they went to high school 5 years ago or 55 years ago, is precisely the problem, isn't it?  But I hardly think it's \"outlandish\" to anyone--it IS 2010.  And evolutionary theory is even less \"outlandish\".  (Admittedly, though, I guess the bible thumpers who are little more than barbarians with cell phones are capable of anything.)\n\nHmmm...shall I apologize for my palpable animosity?  No.\n",

It would be better to frame the question in terms of who holds the belief, i.e. \"Scientists believe that humans evolved from earlier species of animals.\"   It would be the same situation in reverse -- a secular scientist may know about Creationism but if you pose the question \"God created the world in seven days, and all the creatures of the earth on day 6.\" I think you would get a lot of \"no\" answers, but based on the wording of the question you couldn't conclude scientists don't know the story of Genesis.\n\nIncidentally, I also disagree that creationism should be taught in the science classroom, but I fully support the teaching of religion in school. Dan Dennett has a good argument for this:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTepA-WV_oE\n\n",

That understanding may lead to acceptance if we BELIEVE it is sound, but understanding is only a logical process - logical processes are faulty when false axioms are assumed (something humans appear highly prone to do).  Acceptance of any matter is by no means necessary to be literate on that matter.\n\nIn fact, science as we know has been driven by paradigm shifts - by people who do not accept the common beliefs. Accepting something just because it APPEARS logically sound would be practically suicidal to the scientific community.  It's only when we accept theories HYPOTHETICALLY that there's enough context surrounding them to truly develop them into what may one day be the whole truth.",

They can reconcile this with their intellectually lazy notion of \"God did it\" even though it is a bit of a mental brain fart, but still, the two can work in tandem. Even the complex model of evolution can be linked to the intellectually lazy notion of \"God did it\" although not nearly as simply. In the end, I actually think it is high time we relegate religion to the dustbin of society. It is time that America grows up and joins the \u201ccivilized\u201d world and realizes it\u2019s potential.

The only way something solid could travel through a black hole would be to travel faster than light.  Traveling faster than light would obliterate anything solid due to the sheer gravitational friction, and that's not counting the gravity of a black hole.  To send something solid to FTL flight would require something that can make a static warp bubble or a self contained bubble of gravity.  Gravity that is strong enough to withstand outside gravity.  Something like that doesn't exist with current technology.  Yet.  But if Tachyons can escape a black hole, then other things can as well.  When looked at through a spectroscope, a black hole can be seen spewing out cosmic energy from the top and bottom.  That is what is left afterwards, and is the building blocks of all matter/energy in the universe.  Look up both black holes and white holes and you will see they correllate.  They are what constantly pulls in and expells the energy that creates the universe, a literal cosmic sized recycling center that keeps the universe balanced.  Without a balancing factor, the universe would not be here for it would destroy itself.",

    "message": "I second this. The general formula of popular science journalism seems to be: Find something that could suggest something earth-shattering; Find some other scientist with half a brain (a whole is too much, none is too little) and ask them what they think; report as if both ideas have even-level credibility.\n\nNew math that works pops up all the time, it doesn't mean it is so. When it comes to theoretical physics, which is any kind of physics we can't directly observe, it is all about what theory makes the most accurate predictions with the least complexity. In that order.\n\nA complex theory that makes even the smallest improvement to predictions is the new working model. One that can be made more simple but retain the same level of predictive quality, is the new working model.\n\nThe reason that we think of time as fluid is that we are, ourselves, observers. And the math must take that into account and the easiest way to do that is to assume time is fluid. This doesn't mean it is. It just means that the math is more simple if it is. Since it makes the same quality predictions as the HORRIFICALLY complex alternative theories you need to make time progression constant, it is the preferred working model.\n\nIt isn't perfect. For example, the 3 body problem. But it does a better job of predicting things like the orbit of Mercury and how much light will bend around the sun than did the model before it.\n\nSo, what about this new idea with black holes makes better predictions? Well, assuming all else is even, it fits with how we have always presumed the universe to work. Which is that information, and I mean here the physics concept of information, can't be destroyed. Because if you could make information vanish, our history would vanish. We would not be able to trust any observations, nor even our memories. Black holes have long been thought to break this flow of information. There are a few ways to sort of avoid it, such as Hawking's idea that black holes infuse other universes with that information, and I guess presumably it could one day enter another black hole and re-enter ours? Not sure how that works. There is also the idea that when a black hole would evaporate the caught information would be released. However, if this theory suggests another way to have all the effects of a black hole without the loss of information, then perhaps it is a better model.\n\nWe wouldn't know until we could make observations of it. Actually, we may never know, because if black holes make information vanish, we can't really trust what we think we know about them, even when observed.",

Mathematics is a totally abstract concept that does not exist externally, and is by its nature exists entierly within the mind.  Although evolution is supported by the observational evidence, there are some aspects of molecular biology that don't quite fit the evolution theory (at least when it is stated simply).  These require \"tweeks\" in the theory, much as relativity modified the original laws of motion as stated by Newtonian theory.  In mathemtics, the rules are created and the individual cases of mathematical epxressions are based on the rules. Forinstance, there is more than one system of mathematics (particularly self consistant systems of geometry, although Euclidian is the only form with which most of us are familar).   Tomorrow new data could surface that would cause us to throw out the theor of Evolution -- or gravity or classical thermodynamics (which is only a subset of quantum thermodynamics).  There will never be new \"data\", however, in any system of mathematics, as these start as purely mental constructs.",

We'd all still be worshiping Apollo or whatever sun god that was around instead of understanding that the Earth moves around the sun - it's not pulled across the sky by some supernatural being (or do you still believe that?).  I believe we find who and what we are in the trying.

If you are averse to blunt instruments, don't use these kinds of questions in surveys.  I would say they are a necessary evil, however, if you want a wide sample of a large population that isn't going to sit still for essay questions. In the full article, Bruer makes the valid point that if the qualifier \"According to the theory of evolution...\" is inserted before the question, the percentage of \"true\" responses is much higher.  We should consider whether \"scientific literacy\" means \" I've heard of this theory, and I know what it means,\" or \"I've heard of this theory, and I believe it to be true.\"  \n\nA big part of the problem is that at one time a survey which showed a large percentage of the population did not believe currently understood scientific theories was taken to be a sign that our educational system was deficient, and we were falling behind other countries in a threatening world. Today there are prominent people who hold that denial of these theories is perfectly consistent with their alternate beliefs, and so view this as a good thing!   ",

The lateral gene transfer between the marine bacteria and Bacteroides plebeius, which is part of the normal gut flora, is required. That process is likely to be quite rare. What you need is to ingest the particular japanese strain of this bacteria, and you'll be able to benefit fully from sushi. I am tempted to say what you need to do, but will abstain in this respectable forum :-)",

And yes, it's expected that every galaxy should have one at the centre (in addition to having a few million normal-sized black holes scattered among its stars).\n\nThe other thing about black holes is that all they lead to is obliteration. Even before you arrive at the centre of the black hole, all the particles of your body are stripped apart and completely causally separated. (Causally separated means placed completely and forever out of reach of any possible contact or effect on each other - as if every particle is in a different universe... but they're not.) That's something for anyone with pretty ideas about fractal universes to think about.",

    "message": "Everyone needs to stop throwing around the term \"infinite\".  There can be no infinity.  Infinity ruins all physics.  A black hole is not a point in space where gravity grows infinitely strong, it's not infinitely massive, nor infinitely small.  It's strength of pull on another object is based on both their masses and the distance between them.  What happens if one is floating in space and they are drawn by earth gravitational pull.  They fall toward earth at 9.8m/s2, accelerating until reaching terminal velocity.  Same thing would happen in a black hole.  You'd just fall to the core of it's gravity and probably be liquified by the intense heat of friction.  Riddle me this, based on the equation for gravity that gives us 9.8m/s2 here on earth, could there be a black hole with a mass producing a force of gravity of 299,792,458m/s2, the speed of light? Technically, with enough mass and using that equation, yes.  What if it were more than the speed of light?  One law of physics against the other.",

    "message": "All theories to be theories have to be able to be wrong. It is called falsifiability. It does not matter whether it could be wrong or not, it just matters that it is a valid scientific theory and it counts as both valid and important in understanding basic science. Newton's theories are both valid and wrong at the same time. They have been supplanted and expanded by Einstein and others since. Even if Darwinian Evolution is wrong, or rather incomplete in that it does not adequately explain things and in the future a new theory is formulated that does a better job, it does not matter because that is the future and today Darwinian evolution by process of natural selection is the current foundational model for all of the biological sciences. As such it is an extremely important bit of knowledge to have. Maybe if the people that disagreed with the theory so much actually took the time to learn about it they might come up with something better than saying \"God did it\". But that would take scientific literacy.",

    "message": "As DrugMonkey notes, the scientists who are actually doing the work know there's not currently any way around animal experiments for many types of research.  For example, I needed to study the interaction between cells in the bone marrow and a bone tumor.  Because I didn't want to hassle of dealing with animals and also because research review boards require it, I looked long and hard for an alternative way to study the phenomenon, but eventually got as far as I could with culture models.  I wrote up my attempts to find an alternative way of doing the research in my report to the review board.  There's simply no way to model a bone marrow environment in a tumor bearing animal in a culture dish, and then to examine the effect of a drug requires different routes of administration, none of which can be done in vitro.\n\nBelieve me, I wouldn't have done the animal research if there was any way I could have gotten around it, and pretty much everyone else felt the same way. It's costly, time consuming, and inconvenient, but I was able to do research that uncovered a new treatment path for an incurable cancer. Was that a justifiable reason?  ",

It sounds like the specimens collected were deceased as anaerobes are hard to sample due to pesky oxygen getting everywhere.  It would be interesting if they devised a method of collecting the sediment and specimens so that it remained devoid of free oxygen for observation of living multicellular anaerobes.

Also, on what you mentioned about removing all the oxygen that a patient breathes to kill cancer is just a bit unreasonable and illogical. Humans, and most complex mammals require oxygen to do basic cellular processes like hydrolysis, and removing this and replacing it with nitrogen based molecules (which have poor redox potentials generally speaking) would not be a good way to move since it may kill the person.\n\nNevertheless, this discover is pretty damn cool",

    "message": "Funny. But what if we simplify matters and studies this from a more scientific perspective and say that the person with and without prostheses weigth the same and that we know that the only thing generating force in this case are the thighs (the person with prostheses have no calf muscles and can therefore not run as fast as the healthy person). They both are as equally strong but one thing differs the knee joints. It's logical that the spring joint bounces better than the biological joint which mean that more of the force added per step remains longer in the spring. The conclution is that the prosthese person use his energy more efficiant than the biological one. To greatly simplify this think about this as two balls, the balls weigths the same (does not matter in vacuum but anyways) but the other ball is more springy ( the prosthese). If dropped from the same higth which of them stops bouncing first? The ball which's not as springy as the other ball ofcourse! The springier the ball is, the more of its momentum is konserved which leads to lesser force during the impact with the ground which is energy consuming when running. \n\nThe prosthese is not as fast as the biological and therefore should they be accepted in shorter laps where the momentum konsevation doesn't give any advantage, like 100meters sprint. But longer laps give prostheses unfair advantages. ",

    "message": "Folks - be careful with reading too much into this. It is certainly a great discovery that multicellular organisms are now known which can be anaerobic (this was already known for many unicellular organisms) - especially since the vastly efficient energy harvesting that comes from being aerobic was thought to give rise to complex multicellular life in the first place. So the lifeform gets its energy through other processes, not by respiring oxygen (O2). However - and this is the biggie - it does NOT mean we have knowledge of ANY life that can live without atomic Oxygen (O). Think about it - this anaerobe, all previously known anaerobes, and every other lifeform currently known needs the same basic elements: C H N O P S, because these are critical for the building blocks of life (nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates). This \"new\" lifeform still uses all those same building blocks and its fundamental chemistry is still exactly the same as every other life form. In this short, this is definitely still exactly \"life as we know it\". It would be very misleading to think this, or any other anaerobe, \"lives without oxygen\". Anyway, that wouldn't be a problem on other planets... there is enough molecular oxygen to go around the universe, so this should in no way fuel speculations about outer space life. Again, it's the \"structure\" of life that is unique on Earth, and all know life, including this new one, follows the same basic structure. If were to find something, for example, that used Silicon instead of Carbon or Sulfur in place of Oxygen, or information storage in something other thand DNA/RNA, or \"proteins\" made out of something other than amino acids, etc... THAT would be something fundamentally very different, and has yet to be seen.",

Loricifera are hetereotrophic organisms, meaning they have adapted to feeding upon other organisms. Therefore Lorcifera could not survive in space. Some single cell anaerobes derive energy from abiotic compounds, sunlight, or radiation (as some fungi appear to), so they might be able to survive outside the atmosphere. You must also keep in mind that the wide variety of temperatures encountered would have dramatic effects on enzymatic activity, affecting all forms of life.",

    "message": "\"As Einstein demonstrated in his Theory of General Relativity, a passenger inside a spaceship traveling toward a black hole would feel the ship accelerating, while an outside observer would see the ship slow down\"\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect. The passenger would be in free fall, so wouldn't feel any acceleration - in fact would feel no different to empty space until tidal forces became significant at a few thousand km distance (for a stellar mass black hole), and that would feel altogether different from an acceleration.\r\n\r\nObserver outside wouldn't see the ship slow down, they'd see it accelerate into what would seem like an infinite distance into the black hole, getting progressively more red-shifted. If the observer could view events on the ship, or the ship's clock, THAT would appear to slow down.\r\n\r\nAnd this is a prediction from Einstein's theory - I don't think he actually 'demonstrated' it. He didn't put a passenger in a ship and send it into a black hole. That wouldn't be ethical. :)\r\n\r\nMatter does take an infinite time to reach the horizon of the existing hole, from the point of view of anyone outside, but it very quickly enters the horizon of the NEW hole ( = old hole + spaceship ), and at that point there's no problem in saying that it becomes part of the hole from the point of view of an external observer. Perhaps there are Planck length ambiguities here, but I doubt our friends in Ohio have any more idea about that than you or I.\r\n\r\nI wish science journalists would be honest and state that some scientists have developed a mathematical methodology or model in which black holes cannot form - which is interesting enough - instead of suggesting they've \"shown\" anything to be the case. These models inevitably have their own assumptions and provisos which may or may not be far-fetched. It's not as if these guys are overturning the standard view of black holes at all.",

    "message": "@No Guest,\nI think you're confusing the issue of \"appropriate to the forum\" with \"access\".  If the government banned publication of this article, that would be censorship.  But privately controlled media always have editorial control over what they publish. The authors of thei withdrawn article are absolutely free to say whatever they want.  They just can't say it in a \"medical\" or \"science\" journal, because it's not science, it's a political editorial.  \n\nA publication calling itself a \"medical\" or \"science\" journal has a reputation to protect, and it can only do so by limiting its content to articles backed up by data and accepted research protocols.  I think the editor, in this case, confused the popular definition of the word \"hypothesis\" with the scientific definition, and that was a huge error on his part.  I would have done the same thing if I were Elsevier. The authors of the retracted article are free to find a less scientific forum for their commentary.  For example, the Wall Street Journal or a Dallas newspaper would probably publish it, and the authors stand an excellent chance of landing interviews on Fox news.",

    "message": "100% wind power is possible, but there are a couple of details to consider.  First, the fact that wind power can be produced continuously doesn't mean it can be produced in volumes and at times that are consistent with customer demand.  For that you need storage, which is very expensive.  Second, wind machines produce DC power that has to be passed through an inverter, and that process creates some technical problems that could affect the large existing stock of AC motors.  Third, you'd need a lot of wind turbines.  Finding an acceptable place (or places) to put them might be problematic along the eastern seaboard.  Wind power could also be produced in the midwest and moved to the east coast, but that requires transmission lines that are equally difficult to site.\n\nBottom line:  like anything else, 100% wind power is possible, but it will be expensive, time-consuming and require lots of infrastructure most folks do not want in their back yards.",

Indeed they were never real cures and now the killer viruses have mutated and are constantly doing so, the new killer strains emerging are resistant against pharma drugs. They and others are all friends of the large pharmaceuticals and responsible for the sales of tens of billions of wasted and ineffective drugs paid by the taxpayer. What they did not want to see was the alternative strategy emerge of addressing the global killer threat at source.\r\n\r\nFor the only way to stop bird flu/Swine flu et al indefinitely is to address the problem at source and never let it happen in the first place. It is the only way.\r\n\r\nhttp://avian-influenza.cirad.fr/content/download/1931/11789/file/Kennedy-F-Shortridge.pdf \r\n\r\nhttp://distributedresearch.net/blog/tag/world-innovation-foundation\r\n\r\nOtherwise it will one day come back with a vengeance and wipe out a quarter of humanity. The Spanish Flu that killed up to 100 million (a Swine flu variant) will then be seen as the minor event in the world\u2019s history of global pandemics.\r\n\r\nFunny how money always rises above human life itself !\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALLACY THAT THE DRUGS STRATEGY WILL SAVE US FROM A PANDEMIC\r\n\r\nThe facts are taking the most powerful and still richest country in the world the USA as an example,\r\n\r\nInitial Detection \r\nTime Scale - 0 months\r\nSwine Flu first detected \u2013 Influenza A, Novel H1N1 \"swine flu\" was first detected in Mexico City and was made public March 18, 2009. Therefore the first causality was probably at the beginning of March 2009 taking into account the incubation period.\r\n\r\nFirst Death in USA \r\nTime Scale + 2-months later \r\nat the end of April 2009\r\n\r\n1st Vaccine Approved \r\nTime Scale + 6 months 2 weeks\r\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the new swine flu vaccine for use in the United States on September 15, 2009.\r\n\r\nVaccine 1st ready for use in USA\r\nTime Scale + 7 months 1 week\r\nThe vaccine was first ready from mass production and used on  5th October 2009 in the USA\r\n\r\nMost Vaccinated City in the USA by 22nd March 2010\r\nTime Scale + 1 year 1month 1 week\r\nMassachusetts vaccinated more residents against the swine flu and seasonal flu in the fall and winter than any other state.\r\nUp to the end of Winter (March 2010) - The Massachusetts Department of Public Health says 36 percent of residents were inoculated against the swine flu, also known as H1N1, compared with 21 percent nationally. Seasonal flu vaccinations were administered to 57 percent of the population, compared with 37 percent nationwide.\r\nA mere 36% in one USA city and where nationally only 21% had the vaccine by March 22nd 2010.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish flu of 1917/18 did its worst between week 16 and week 26. \r\n\r\nConsidering this fact by the time we get any vaccine, most of us will be well dead. Fact not fiction. Therefore the vaccine strategy is totally flawed and we have to move from this stupid strategy to a standpoint of never letting it happen in the first place \u2013 the preventative strategy not cure strategy and the only strategy that will actually work. \r\n\r\nThat strategy is - http://avian-influenza.cirad.fr/content/download/1931/11789/file/Kennedy-F-Shortridge.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Everything I've ever read about \"hobbits\" seems to say it was the developement of an ape-like being that evolved into an erect being, mostly or solely due to spending most of the time in water, which changed many things about it, including the hips & legs, becoming erect from floating upright & from swimming, among many other things.

We should encourage such engagement in public discourse, but we should also examine carefully the substance of his arguments.  The substance is what more than 400 French climate scientists are responding to.  I wish greenhouse gasses did not contribute to AGW.  I wish HIV did not cause AIDS.  I welcome arguments for both propositions.  But more do I welcome the highlighting of errors, distortions of the data, and outright lies in such arguments.

    "message": "I think like many Americans Steve is being \"Americentric\" in his viewpoint. Other than the Yellow river, most of the lakes you mention are in very dry to extremely dry climates. These areas probably shouldn't have any real populations, maybe 300-400 year ago numbers. And...in that regard Steve makes a good point in that population control is the only real answer. \n\nChad and Australia (to use your examples) have climates that have been getting drier and will continue to do so as the climate changes. It all really comes down to how much the regional ecology can support the people living in it. China is ravenous in it's consumption right now. The Yellow river has several damns and irrigates crops throughout the region. Ironically, these same dams also cause the worst (deadliest) flooding in the world. \n\nWhile some areas need to look at conserving it's water for future use (places that rely on lakes/reservoirs and have dry environments), and while better irrigation techniques can reduce water loss to the environment, making a big hoopla over the water we use to produce corn is \"pushing it\" IMO. \n\nAs a side note, Ft Mac uses a lot of water to produce oil from the sands, and much of this water gets polluted.

Indeed they were never real cures and now the killer viruses have mutated and are constantly doing so, the new killer strains emerging are resistant against pharma drugs. They and others are all friends of the large pharmaceuticals and responsible for the sales of tens of billions of wasted and ineffective drugs paid by the taxpayer. What they did not want to see was the alternative strategy emerge of addressing the global killer threat at source.\r\n\r\nFor the only way to stop bird flu/Swine flu et al indefinitely is to address the problem at source and never let it happen in the first place. It is the only way.\r\n\r\nhttp://avian-influenza.cirad.fr/content/download/1931/11789/file/Kennedy-F-Shortridge.pdf \r\n\r\nhttp://distributedresearch.net/blog/tag/world-innovation-foundation\r\n\r\nOtherwise it will one day come back with a vengeance and wipe out a quarter of humanity. The Spanish Flu that killed up to 100 million (a Swine flu variant) will then be seen as the minor event in the world\u2019s history of global pandemics.\r\n\r\nFunny how money always rises above human life itself !\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALLACY THAT THE DRUGS STRATEGY WILL SAVE US FROM A PANDEMIC\r\n\r\nThe facts are taking the most powerful country in the world the USA as an example,\r\nDetection \r\nTime Scale - 0 months\r\nSwine Flu first detected \u2013 Influenza A, Novel H1N1 \"swine flu\" was first detected in Mexico City and was made public March 18, 2009. Therefore the first causality was probably at the beginning of March 2009 taking into account the incubation period.\r\n\r\nFirst Death in USA \r\nTime Scale + 2-months later \r\nat the end of April 2009\r\n\r\n1st Vaccine Approved \r\nTime Scale + 6 months 2 weeks\r\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the new swine flu vaccine for use in the United States on September 15, 2009.\r\n\r\nVaccine 1st ready for use in USA\r\nTime Scale + 7 months 1 week\r\nThe vaccine was first ready from mass production and used on  5th October 2009 in the USA\r\n\r\nMost Vaccinated City in the USA by 22nd March 2010\r\nTime Scale + 1 year 1month 1 week\r\nMassachusetts vaccinated more residents against the swine flu and seasonal flu in the fall and winter than any other state.\r\nUp to the end of Winter (March 2010) - The Massachusetts Department of Public Health says 36 percent of residents were inoculated against the swine flu, also known as H1N1, compared with 21 percent nationally. Seasonal flu vaccinations were administered to 57 percent of the population, compared with 37 percent nationwide.\r\nA mere 36% in one USA city and where nationally only 21% had the vaccine by March 22nd 2010.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish flu of 1917/18 did its worst between week 16 and week 26. \r\n\r\nConsidering this fact by the time we get any vaccine, most of us will be well dead. Fact not fiction. Therefore the vaccine strategy is totally flawed and we have to move from this stupid strategy to a standpoint of never letting it happen in the first place \u2013 the preventative strategy not cure strategy and the only strategy that will actually work. \r\n\r\nThat strategy is - http://avian-influenza.cirad.fr/content/download/1931/11789/file/Kennedy-F-Shortridge.pdf\r\n\r\n",

The scientific community is slowly beginning to join me in my little \"SOS Save Our Shuttle\" campaign. Buzz Aldrin now supports the SPACE SHUTTLE (see The Huffington Post, March 18, 2010). We have failed to utilize this magnificent, elegant, versatile, S A F E spacecraft in more ways than I can list here. We just simply can not abandon the $100 Billion and 30 years of space exploration expertise we have invested in the SPACE SHUTTLE. A \"morphed and stretched\"\" SPACE SHUTTLE can take man to geosynchronous orbit to service and repair hundreds of satellites, serve as the command module for lunar excursions and provide transportation for astronauts to Mars and selected moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Restarting, from scratch, a comparable deep space program will set us back another $250 Billion. That is a dollar swing of $350 Billion to drop the SPACE SHUTTLE right now.

In all applications I can think of, the water is recycled and reused in closed heating and cooling systems, that includes the steam turbin generator. As far as watering crops, ahhh, what else you gona do? Not grow food and starve? LOL\r\n\r\nMuch of the water used in argiculture is pumped from rivers, or falls as rain. this all runs to the sea anyway and what you get is what you get. If you're not running the river dry (Haven't heard of any rivers drying up lately) the point is moot. Sorry to be blunt, but all this Climate Change, and saving the environment, and water conservation, can only logically boil down to one solution and that is population control.",

You'd be hard-pressed to find that single bubble with a microscope, let alone noticing the difference with the naked eye, so don't be thrown by the misleading, frothy, ocean surface photos accompanying the article.  Spread those bubbles over a unit thickness area of one square meter and 99.9999% of the sunlight will miss those 1 ppm bubbles.\r\n\r\nAlso note, the bubbles are micro-bubbles (specifically ~ 2 microns according to Seitz) that could stay suspended for days because of their size (remember Stokes Law). This process is low cost compared to upending the entire world economy (which will work only if EVERY country goes along with it), completely reversible in a matter of days, and is based on solid scientific concepts. With a nod to William of Ockham, sometimes the simplest solution is the best.  ",

You and your fellow Merck executives have unlimited power to identify, hire and retain any scientist you and they want. You cannot have it both ways. Merck's performance is a result of your ability to judge the quality of people you hire and your decision to put them in key research positions. When you get rid off competent people and retain and protect the incompetent ones, you get what you are asking for. Merck's performance is exactly what to be expected based on your actions as an executive and on the quality of those \"scientists\" you favored during all your 24 years at Merck. Merv, do you remember your own suggestion? I do: \"change the people or change the people\". This is probably the most important suggestion you ever made and Merck should act on it to become the leader again of pharmaceutical research. Executives who cannot judge the quality of scientists and the occupants of the positions they filled should be let go and Merck's research should be built from scratch.",

    "message": "Hmmm? Some time about the sixth grade, I learned that there are about thirteen original ideas.  Mr. Atran seems to have made at least for him a startling discovery. We need social scientists to understand the way of terrorists and non-Napoleanic war tactics. Who knew!!\r\n\r\nThe notion that the DoD and by implication the rest of the Federal government responsible for our security--DHS, NSA, CIA, FBI--has somehow ignored the need for social scientists and psychologists in an important much less minor role in the war on terrior is (uh) sophomoric. Why the Subcommittee invited this lightweight to testify is hard to understand. Oh!  Maybe Jerry Post from George Washington and say George Everly from Johns Hopkins among a host of others already engaged in fighting terror were busy. \r\n\r\nThe service of such professionals continues today. For instance, shortly after 9-11, I was asked by DHS to assemble and manage a 24-7 cadre of academic experts on weapons of mass destruction.  The objective was to help trouble shoot response and communicate the nature of an attack and how the response would be carried out, and why, etc. Early on, in consultation with DHS officials, we concluded that one of if the central issues was to put the human factor up front and center by having social scientists, psychologists, and a full array of other disciplines as a major part of our team--thus the reference to Jerry and George. Even so, some knowledge of DARPA, if only their calls for proposal, might lead, even the most unaware, to suspect that human vagueries would be important.\r\n\r\nAs I read deeply into this article, I decided to see who Mr. Scott is. At first, I thought I imagined that an error had been made and that maybe he is an adjunct in the Drama Department. Academics embedded with rifles! Soldier-psychologists and sociolologists--you bet.  So while many US citizens, not just academics, may still rail against the wars, particularly IRAQ, the military is quite capable of having soldiers with the technical backgrounds, even PhDs and Post doc-level individuals, amongst their ranks.\r\n\r\nAm I angry that our tax dollars are wasted on such pap like this that is camouflaged as expertise.",

    "message": "It is a strong chunk of \"evidence,\" but I posit that it does not fully constrain the CO2 picture. If validated with further data points gathered in similar formations from relatively modern formations -- or from formations created in intermediate times from the early- and mid-Archean to the Cambrian, the point might be made.  I agree with Kasting.  Basically this is an evidential item, but solar physics suggests the linear luminosity increase [of ~1%/100My] calls for a great many other contributory GHG's.  The evidence for snowball and ice ball Earth era's is very convincing during the most recent last 2Gy, but the Sun is already warm enough to quantify the insolation and correlate it with better atmosheric assessments.  That is, by then Bacteria have put a lot of O in the air. \n\nMethane, early, has to play a part -- but if the early biogenic battle was between species producing O and CH4 the atmospheric result shows a longer lifetime for the O, so it builds up. The biogenic CH4 production continues to this day.  We need to be thankful it is not a biogenically dominant component in this era.     \n\nDidachus touches on the geothermal balance -- which we know is not an insignificant factor in the first Gy.  Geothermal outflow continues, mantle differentiation still drives tectonics, and at best the story on early atmospheric GHG's is not completed or much constrained by the Nature report.\n\nRight now it [this report] looks like a thumbtack holding a scrap of note pad paper on the bulletin board -- not yet a book on the shelf, or the desktop.  It appears to be good work that needs more lines of different observational physical evidence to flesh it out.  The truth is \"out there\" even if heavily recycled from it's appearance on the Earth's surface.\n\nMaybe the biological component was more significant, and methane was a larger factor -- in early periods.\nHeterogeneous Hadean Hafnium: Evidence of Continental Crust at 4.4 to 4.5 Ga -- also weighs in [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci;310/5756/1947?maxtoshow=&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=Hadean+era&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT]\n\nIdeas of Life also enter:\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci;315/5814/937c?maxtoshow=&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=Hadean+era&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=10&resourcetype=HWCIT\n\nFor my part, I come away going to Solar Physics for a respite.\n\nThe very fact that huge quantities of C are contained in non biogenic rocks as well as the later limestones suggests that early C was bound to O and possibly N in significant quantities -- but this more than 100 times the current airborn or biological quantity of C we know about -- had to reside \"somewhere\" in the early environment.  To repeat:  Where was the C hiding in the Hadean and Archean -- if not in the atmosphere?\n\nI guess it is fair to say we need a lot more data points, as well as a comparison with even older Rocks  to bolster the small CO2 atmosheric component this work indicates. [? No wonder algae grew so slowly back then, deprived of easy C in the air . . ?] \n\nFor Earth, the Sun turns on at the beginning of the Hadean.  The moon is splashed out within the first 20 - 50 million years.  But the oceans return, and tectonics and differentiation continues throughout the Hadean into the Archean . . . [I like the closer to 20My in the beginning, rather than the 50my -- and where the heck in the Galaxy were the Supernovae of the Sun and Earth's birth -- were we nearer to the Galactic core. . . you know, the galactic geography. . .? ] \n\nBy the time of the Archean, the Sun is about 10% warmer than at main sequence ignition.  So don't wander into the faint Sun as 30% diminished, think of it as only 20% diminished at least.  It was warmer than that 30% suggestion -- so think of it as roughly 80% of now.\n\nIn fact, at dim sun ignition [4.567Gya] Venus's water would be pure greenhouse gas and the water/heat death of Venus, inevitable.   Obviously the Earth's Hadean oceans were liquid -- think: they are also liquid in most or much of the Archean. And the Sun warms from then on.  Snowballs and Iceballs occur later, and such planetary episodes are likely all in Earth's Past.\n\nWe can still have minor Ice Ages, after humankind are gone, and after what traces of life left on the planet have been able to extract the blip of CO2 we've left -- and which may close the chapter on many current lifeforms.  Geological and biological means of removing our CO2 legacy will possibly return to pre-human balance as soon as 1.5 to 2my.   But I am suggesting full planetary scale snow and ice are not possible because of the warming Sun.  We, as a species, are on the verge of \"Climate Control\" -- if we do not blow it.\n\nI think more observational data will help quantify the CO2 of the Archean.  For purely emotional reasons, I think the 1000 ppmv is low for CO2; anomolous.  Harder science can swing my fickle emotions, however.",

    "message": "The theory pertaining to the energy of the expanding universe falling below the energy threshold required for creating matter, just moments after the big bang, seems to be linked to these new finding.  How can time stop in a black hole from the gravitational pull in one spot inversely exceeding the speed of light due to the theory of relativity?  At the very beginings of our universe's creation, there was not only all the mass of a previous star condensed into a small space; rather, the entire mass of the entire universe was compacted into a relatively even smaller space in terms of the densities required to contain the matter.  From these assumptions about time slowing to zero once past a certain event horizon, one could conclude that the big bang never made it off the starting block.  the minute all matter in the known universe was created, it simultaneously stopped time itself by acting as a \"Black Hole\" and has just sat there ever since.  the phenomena that resulted did no such thing.  if light is unable to escape the grasp of a black hole, representing only a tiny fraction of the original mass concentration during the big bang, it leads to only one conclusion.  there is something out there faster than the speed of light. How else would light, energy, mass, and time be able to grow outward through such a brilliantly enormous in strength concentration of matter? The inverse of this would be rather than something exceeding the speed of light during the big bang, gravitational pull in a black hole does not overcome time, but rather bends it away from the standard observation point. using infinite terms in describing black holes is a mathematical mis-interpretation of a number that is larger than we can easily comprehend.  clearly, if the gravitational pull inside a black hole cannt be larger than the initial value of gravitational pull at the first instants of the big bang, the value of gravity in the black hole cannot be infinite by means of being trumped by the big bang concentration of mass.  mathematics is what can no longer describe our universe in quantitative terms that are accurately applicable to real world physics.  Stopping the passage of time with any amount of matter has already been proven false by the universe growing past the initial stages of the big bang, thus time overcoming all matter in our universe ",

Carey advocates allowing individual farmers to Control this moth (LBAM) in the same manor farmers control dozens of other similar native tortricidae moths and thousands of varieties of insects, NOT REQUIRING A STATE PROGRAM and NOT HAVING TAXPAYERS PAY FOR A STATE PROGRAM.\n\n2. Eradication of the moth was not feasible two years ago just as CDFA and USDA finally admit that Eradication is not feasible now.  There is no proof that the moth has spread as CDFA advertises.  Numbers of traps and locations of traps have changed sufficiently from then to now such that no definitive (scientifically accurate) statement can be made about the number of moths and if they have spread from two years ago to now or not.  Whether their population increased or decreased, whether their territory has spread or consolidated, Eradication was not possible before, just as now.\n\n3. Aerial spray would have been impossible even if the entire state of California was flat like a chessboard and only the size of Rhode Island.  But because California is huge and because California has the maximum variety of terrains (mountains, hills, valleys) and so many varieties furthest from flat, Aerial spray was never a tool that could eradicate LBAM.  It was beyond impossible to eradicate LBAM in California then or now.\n\nSterile Moth Release is even less effective as a tool to eradicate LBAM, but that we'll save for a future comment.\n\n4. CDFA and USDA were 100% wrong.  So now in order to never admit their errors, they pretend that the conditions changed and that is why we can't eradicate.  Carey and other legitimate scientists (not pressured by, or afraid of the CDFA) said Eradication was impossible three years ago.\n\n5. The CDFA and USDA only got involved because they said that \"Eradication\" was necessary and possible.  Now CDFA and USDA are trying to hang on to some program by switching to Control, when both previously excluded Control.  If CDFA remains, CDFA will interfere with farmer's ability to properly control LBAM; that is a certainty.\n\n6. The only reason that CDFA and USDA are remaining in this LBAM issue is because they want the $100 Million of taxpayer money every year for as many years as they can jump and dodge and sleaze their way around the truth and continue to perpetuate this fraud.\n\n7. CDFA's own EIR document states \"NO CROP DAMAGE\" in California by LBAM, NONE!  Yet CDFA continues to deliver false claims of damage to the media to fool the public and the elected officials to perpetuate the fraud and keep their position in this program.  (Draft EIR, Chapter #3 page 3-20 lines 6,7 and page 3-21 lines 3,4 below table 3-16: \"NO CROP DAMAGE\").\n\n8. The moth has been in California for close to 50 years and there is NO DOCUMENTATION OF DAMAGE by LBAM at any agriculture commissioner office in the state of California. CDFA has thousands of people desperately trying to find LBAM damage.  CDFA has faked pictures to attempt to fabricate damage.  CDFA has taken damage from other insects and attempted to blame LBAM.  That is how much AG Kawamura, the secretary of the CDFA, wants an LBAM $$$ program.\n\n9. A.G. Kawamura, Secretary of the CDFA lied to CBS TV News and the public.\nSteve Lyle, CDFA PR Director, lied to the media and the public.\nJohn Connell, retired director of CDFA plant & animal health, lied to the Sonoma Board of Supervisors and to the public.\nRobert Leavitt, current Director of CDFA plant & animal health, lied to Senator Florez, the Senate Committee on Food and Agriculture and to the public.\n\nIn this LBAM issue, scientists, business owners, employees, city people, country people, farmers and all honest people are together against the dishonest and fraudulent program of the CDFA and USDA.  I hope that I have shared some relevant information with you for you to know which side you are on.\n\nBest to all,\n\nRW\n",

Only recently has the stimulus rescued the remaining professors who could continue. By the way, medical research in the US is NOT done at \"research companies\", it's done at universities under NIH grants. That proves how little you know about what you're criticizing.",

By doing this, much sun-light can reflect into the sky, so my method can efficiently cool the earth.\r\n\r\nThen I have another opinion that we can mosaic zillions of micro-reflective-material on the roads, streets, motorways or on the many roofs of buildings. By this method, we also can reflect more sun-light out of the earth by the first direct reflection through short wave rather than by the second reflection of surface objection through long wave. One benefit of this method is that it will have no influence on the evaporative effect of oceans and another benefit is that it can avoid to be intake by fishes. \r\n",

If people stopped assuming they understood and spent more time asking for clarification, the world would be a better place.  \nI applaud the research and am interested in what they find in future research, I just hope the researchers don't let preconceptions and assumptions about what Aspies or any other group are actually thinking color their interpretations.",

    "message": "The 1988 exchange was only a fledgling first round debate and Science canceled the other rounds after Blattner, Gallo, and Temin lost round 1 so decisively.  Their primary evidence was epidemiological correlations instead of microbiological, and since correlations cannot imply causation, and strong microbiological evidence must be available against HIV prior to it's inclusion in the 1985 AIDS definition, the definition's required match between the hypothetical cause HIV and AIDS were artifactualy generating most of the correlations, so argumenjts of B, G, T looked very weak.  The reason that so much dissent or rethinking exists is because there has still not been a review of the literature that presents strong microbiological evidence against HIV, for example.  So whether it's 1988, 1998 or 2010, debate is still justified until that vital evidence is produced because the Emperor still is without clothes.  Also, without that evidence, using the term denialist 'begs the question' in circular fashion because the very premise that justifies the term (strong evidence exists against HIV) is merely assumed while the term is used to avoid presenting evidence to verify the premise.  So the claim that many people are dead because of AIDS denialism is an additional dimension of begging the question, because again, the evidence that HIV causes AIDS must be produced to make the claim. That's what this is all about. Chigwedere et al also beg the question with their computer model, that's set up on the very assumptions in question, then the flawed model produces numbers that are being used to reinforce the concept 'denialism'  and justify imprisonment of those who dissent...another tautology.  US National Library of Medicine rejected the petition by the 'complaining 18' to delist Medical Hypotheses because their argument about peer review was spurious.  The phrase you use, \"fanatical zeal to support authority even when that authority exists to extinguish a people\", could just as easily be applied to the AIDS establishment if AIDS drugs are really hurting patients instead of helping, which is a point that dissenters make, and therefore crucial to discuss until those that work for the AIDS establishment can adequately resolve data descrepancies that indicate the drugs harm more than help long term.  Elsevier as owner of course has the right to do what it wants with MH, but it brings into question whether owners of journals should be held to a higher criteria than merely looking at the bottom line, because the history of science strongly suggests that because peer review has many flaws, which include it being used by those of the dominant view, including by knowledge monopolies and research cartels, to hold on to the primary funding sources and hence power.   The fears are understandable, especially as fanned by those in the AIDS establishment, but this is supposed to be the process of science, not a religion although the 'complaining 18' seem to be doing there best to force conversion and baptism.

    "message": "The individual commenting here as \"Peter Duesberg\" uses World War II-era terminology (\"blitz,\" above) and also seems to live in the past scientifically. In 1988, the decision of Science to sponsor a debate was perhaps justified. In 1998, a similar forum would have been ridiculous. Today, some would argue that sponsoring such a debate would be tantamount to supporting genocide. Whether their deaths were the goal or not, many, many people are dead today as a result of AIDS denialism. The fanatical zeal to oppose authority even if it leads to mass death is simply the flip side of the fanatical zeal to support authority even when that authority exists to extinguish a people.\n\nStill, Peter Duesberg and Bruce Charlton are welcome to endorse or publish whatever scientifically unsupported, public health endangering drivel they like. Bruce Charlton and his idealistic supporters can publish ten journals of stimulating hypotheses. However, national, taxpayer-funded entities like the US National Library of Medicine should not be obliged to support or tacitly endorse their journals, Elsevier has every right to cancel its own journals or transfer editorship, and people concerned about the use of an apparently \"scientific\" publication to legitimize unproven theories and peddle unproven cure-alls have free speech rights to ask for responsible oversight.",

    "message": "Good question - dogs do not distinguish words in human language per se. They are reinforced (via some form of reward or punishment) to associate a particular sound with a particular effect (i.e., \"bad\" = about to be hit with newspaper, \"good\" = treat coming my way). The word itself has no inherent meaning to the dog, as you could just as easily train it to associate \"bad\" with a reward and \"good\" with a punishment. It is quite a different story if a dog can actually produce different sounds to convey different messages to another member of their species. Of course, this ability might have been learned by the dog at some point in the same way as they \"learned\" the meaning of \"bad\", but the fact that they actually produce the sound, rather than merely respond to it, is what is important here.",

The fact that in the larvae of rainbow trout ion uptake by the gills initially prevails on oxigen uptake does not surprise me: arguably the need for a specialized respiratory organ decreases with animal sizes, whereas ion balance becomes particularly critical (especially in fresh water). The gills of fish are a modification of the pharingeal basket of tunicates, an organ specialized in filtration (for feeding in marine habitats). Overall, I can't see the importance of the results.",

    "message": "             It\u2019s a misleading insinuation that a journal has a peer review problem because they accepted a paper rejected by another journal, since this occurs on a regular basis in publishing.  Additionally, Medical Hypotheses had previously published other articles that questioned the HIV-AIDS hypothesis.  Furthermore, many of the complainers of Medical Hypotheses had also petitioned the Library of Medicine to deselect Medical Hypothesis abstracts in MEDLINE/PUBMED because Medical Hypotheses was not peer reviewed, but the petition was rejected reinforcing their complaint as spurious.  Finally, instead of complaining about the journal, the main complainers being \u2018scientists\u2019 could have readily published an article as a rejoinder to Duesberg et al to point out any specific \u201cerrors or misinterpretations\u201d themselves, rather than waiting for an anonymous panel 8 months later to do it.  Ignoring all these basic facts, Elsevier then turned a blind eye to what in all appearances seems to be the central purpose of the paper that Duesberg et al responded to (Chigwedere, 2008), which was to avenue the elimination of those who criticize the HIV-AIDS hypotheses through the conception of a computer model based upon the very assumptions questioned by critics; a model that generated an estimated number of 330,000 unnecessary AIDS deaths in South Africa, almost 25 times greater than the number of AIDS deaths indicated by the South African Statistics agency.  The paper then implied that government run public health agencies are \u2018science authority\u2019, that scientists that disagree or criticize official pronouncements of public health agencies should be punished legally while the lead author Pride Chigwedere, as the co-discoverer of the AIDS drug Lamivudine (a nucleoside analogue) that WHO recommends in combination with other toxic drugs as the first-line antiviral therapy treatment regimen in Zimbabwe and other developing nations, has a potential conflict of interest.\r\n\tElsevier appeared to react merely from fear of losing profits, instigated by political blackmail, not from any regard for a fit process of science.  Subsequently it convened an anonymous panel to obtain the changes the blackmailers wanted, although the panel of 5 reviewers could not conclude that either of the two articles on trial were a \u201cthreat to global public health\u201d or were \u201cpotentially libelous\u201d (the originally stated concerns by Elsevier).  Meanwhile no one on the panel, not to mention the blackmailers, seems to be aware that the idealistic reputation of peer review has been effectively challenged, if not damaged, in recent years.  Richard Smith the editor of the British Medical Journal, for example, noted in 2002 that \u201cRefereeing is expensive, time-consuming, inaccurate, subject to bias or worse, doesn\u2019t catch errors let alone fraud--and there\u2019s no objective evidence that it works better than the independent judgment of a qualified editor\u201d.   Indeed hundreds of studies have endeavored to evaluate the effectiveness of peer review, with no definitive evidence found that it protects integrity, or that it reliably results in better papers being published (The Great Betrayal, Horace Freeland Judson:2004).  Indicative is a review of 135 comparative studies by Jefferson et al (JAMA 287, 5 June: 2784-86), presented at the Fourth International Congress on Peer Review in 2002 that concluded: \u201cUntil such research is undertaken, peer review should be regarded as an untested process with uncertain outcomes\u201d!\r\n",

But as some have allready pointed out, at the same time it will starve the life that needs sunlight in the ocean. Not to mentione all the rubbish it will create. As for mixing air into the surface water of the ocean, this will also increase the O2 level and CO2 level which in turn will change the chemical equilibrium in the sea. Which again will change the balance between which alge, bacteria and plancton that will thrive. I have not read the article by Mr. Seitz, but I hope he have discussed some of these side effects. Any \"geoengineering\" should include scientists from as many fields as possible to prevent any catastrofic effects. Best option to \"save\" the planet in my opinion is to reduce energy consumtion and stop the increase of the human population.",

Creatures which have adapted using properties of light to create camouflage, or assist in hunting or evasion strategies will be negatively affected. All the seabirds which feed by spotting fish may find hunting difficult. \n\nWhile the micro-bubble idea is certainly creative, and might well cool the planet, be easy to turn off, and relatively cheap and easy to produce. I think it has huge potential to cause absolute havoc in ocean ecosystems - (which we still don't have a decent working model for - or even a reasonable approximation).  At a time when we are just beginning to investigate the possibility that our long-founded beliefs are wrong - \"that the ocean is so vast and so productive, and phytoplankton being the basis of productivity, there is no possibility that we could seriously damage ocean productivity by long term exploitation and removal of productively useful biomass...\"\nHowever, research is starting to appear which suggests that over-exploitation may indeed lead to an impoverished, nutrient poor system, affecting species which are not exploited.\n\nWhen we are still stumbling around in the dark, knowing so little of how the ocean really functions - to implement this sort of idea is criminally irresponsible. There is literally NO way to determine what the impacts will be on ocean eco-systems, because we can't model it in any meaningful way. \n\nOk, so we could turn it off - if/when we realize there's a problem. How much more damage can our oceans take and still provide a significant fraction of the world's food supply?\n",

Bubbles may be produced naturally but since their natural creation is balanced by their destruction the total amount of bubbles in the seas and hence the total heat they reflect does not change. We can shift the equilibrium in one direction or another. This can in turn change the balance between heat radiated into space and heat received from the sun. As long as the total concentration of a greenhouse gas changes it does not matter what the source is. The effect will be the same.",

The bacteria \"eat\" the waste, breaking it down until there is much less biological oxygen demand (BOD) and the hazard to the environment is controlled. A secondary effect is that carbon dioxide in the air dissolves into the water making carbonic acid that acidifies the water enough so that it has to be neutralized. I'm concerned that tiny bubbles would 1) prevent light from reaching life in the sea 2) would exacerbate ocean acidifying & hurting coral 3) encourage unnatural bacteria or algae blooms 4) use energy that makes the problem worse",

    "message": " The analogy that time 'stops' at the edge of a 'point of no return' just seems silly.  What can you expect from such a young species in a universe said to be billions of years old?  Just take a look at all the holes in table of elements.  One should note that \"reality\" concerning the universe as a whole has changed repeatedly since the invention of the telescope.  The old theory of the ball in a spaceship argues that things may move faster than light, provided some sort of device is used to prevent passengers from becoming smudges on the back wall at velocity speeds.  Now I'm just a bit irritated about this whole mess.  First, a small group of folk decide for the rest of us that Pluto is no longer a planet.  Now, black holes don't exist?  Those were a few of my favorite things to read about as a child.  What next, maybe that galaxies are not really collections of stars, but rather rips in space-time looking through a skewed light field at our own juxtaposition in space?  Or perhaps that we are simply billions of tiny motes lost in our understanding of our own ineptitude when it comes to observation of our surroundings.  It's the flat earth theory all over again.  Our understanding of the universe is like a candle to the sun, we have a long way to go before we get there.  Someone develop the warp engine already, then we can zip out there and take a look.",

Women must  stand up to big pharma\u2019s bullying them  to over-medicate with antidepressants washing out their emotions & personalities and interfering being mothers, sisters, brothers, daughters, partners and lovers.. Women are targeted for antidepressants by big Pharma in the same way that tobacco companies targeted us 70 years ago. Drug companies are so effective at selling unhappiness to women that women take more than twice as many antidepressants as men.Like effexor Wyeth/Pfizer plans on using modern marketing techniques and direct payments to doctors to have Pristiq over prescribed instead of used based on evidence based diagnosis. http://sadnessaddiction.blogspot.com/",

At this point it can ricochet back to the first choice of smoking pot and continuing pot use (thus becoming simply one joint in a long procession of them). On the other hand it can be a refusal and continuing life without having smoked one. \r\n\r\nVery complex. ",

However there should be more emphasis on \r\nM-Theory/String Theory, because if there are 10 or 26 dimensions, at a subatomic level, then Steven Hawings problems with Gravity can be satisfied. Also, these speculative theorys do lead to a significant correlation to The Big Bang, or better yet, the BANGS!  They are probably INFINITE, and are constantly happening, however only at a subatomic level and only according to the theory of spacetime!  And also, does anyone really believe that their is an \"Edge of the Universe?\" i.e., Such as Cris Columbus being forwarned, \"That the world was flat?\"\r\n*(Spacetime; The term space-time has taken on a generalized meaning beyond treating space \r\ntime events with the normal 3+1 dimensions.  Speculative theories such as string theory predict \r\n10 or 26 dimensions (with M-theory predicting 11 dimensions: 10 spatial and 1 temporal), but \r\nthe existence of more than four dimensions would only appear to make a difference at the \r\nsubatomic level.)   * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime\r\nSincerely,\r\nEric D.

There is a limit (or there is with our science us little fallible beings created) It's just that the escape velocity exceeds that of the (known) fastest thing in the universe, which is light. And simply because the spaceship appears to stop doesn't mean that it did, in reality. Science is based off of observations, so it is true that the spaceship stops to an observer outside of the black holes point of no return, but what about the observers inside of the point of no return? They would still be there, and not stuck in one frame of time (or a quantum second, If remember correctly), so what does this say? Well, it is called the point of no return, which means that once you pass that invisible line the escape velocity of the black hole is too great to be overcome by anything (we think!) in the universe, so you cannot go back, essentially splitting the two observers into places where they can never compare their data, this solves the paradox of appearing to stop, he does stop, yet he doesn't. I'd like to hear you're comments on this, I probably overlooked something!",

    "message": "One might have thought that there would have been some mildly critical digging on the part of USA Today, New York Times, Washington Post, or Wall Street Journal on this story. I find Carl Wieman to be well organized, capable of making a good presentation with effective use of information technology, and a persuasive lecturer with a high energy level. \n\nHowever, I think that it would be fair to ask Wieman about the following letter from Dr. Marcel Dvorak to the National Post. The President of UBC has refused to comment on this letter. Does what Dvorak wrote reflect in part downstream effects of styles of science teaching and the broken interface between the life sciences and arts subjects such as the teaching of English and the terms of biology and medicine? \n\nCopyright National Post Company Mar 29, 2008\nRe: The Ugly Face Of Medicare, John Turley-Ewart, March 28.\nUnfortunately, Jennie's story is not at all unusual in our health care\nsystem. The quality of care she received is directly related to the\nlack of capacity at multiple levels within the public health care\nsystem. For a number of years, governments have equated numbers of\nphysicians and surgeons directly with health care costs and have tried\nunsuccessfully to control the latter by restricting the former. The\nparadox is that Jennie's life-long disability is likely to be more\ncostly to society than it would have been to provide adequate surgical\nmanpower to provide her the timely surgical care and rehabilitation\nshe required.\n\nI have had the privilege to train over 30 surgeons in a spine\nfellowship program at the Vancouver General Hospital and the\nUniversity of British Columbia. Out of these, only seven are\npractising spine surgery in Canada. As a country, we train enough\nsurgeons, but we do not have opportunities for them. At the University\nof British Columbia we are in the process of doubling our medical\nschool class size, however, without beds and operating time, we are\nsimply providing highly trained physicians and surgeons for other\ncountries.\n\nIn the past week or two, I could relate to you stories similar to\nJennie's, but with the diagnoses of misdiagnosed spine fractures,\nparalysis due to metastatic cancer to the spine that was undiagnosed\nfor weeks and gradual paralysis due to spinal stenosis (an easily\ntreatable degenerative condition).\n\nI am amazed at the lack of public outcry regarding the lack of access\nto appropriate care, and I often reflect that if we treated our pet\nanimals the same way we treat many of our patients, the outcry from\nanimal rights groups would be deafening.\n\nDr. Marcel Dvorak, head, Division of Spine, Vancouver Coastal Health\nand University of British Columbia.\n\nThat is the first question that I would ask Carl: What is your analysis of this Dvorak letter? Do you think that clicking and multiple choice could ameliorate the diagnostic syndromes described by Dvorak? There have been complaints about the overuse of the clicker in biology at UBC. Can we see the evidence, the UBC course evaluations, so that we can assess the effectiveness of clicking for ourselves? \n\nAfter the Amy Bishop matter, I thought that the President of the USA would say that to get federal funding all American universities would have to have open performance reviews and course evaluations. Strangely, he did not seem to grasp the issue at all. What is Carl's explanation of the somewhat painful and confused set of practices in relation to course evaluations at UBC? \n\nThe second most important question for Carl is the Regina v. Hwi Lee judgment of Judge R.D. Fratkin April 28, 2009. When I went over to the Richmond courthouse to get the judgment, I found that it was not at all in demand. The Korean student Hwi Lee made threats against biosciences at UBC. He was terrified of making oral presentations. Instead of helping to strengthen high school biology in BC so that such problems would be identified and dealt with far earlier, UBC appeared not to be able to grasp the language issues at all. An indirect reflection perhaps of how Carl tends to devalue language. I was stunned when he told me that language and science are totally separate, so that clearly he would not be able to understand how international students would need enriched English (or French) programs to thrive in science in America or Canada.\n\nUBC has been afflicted for at least a dozen years by professors in the English department teaching their own books instead of adopting some of the most remarkable products of the corpus revolution in linguistics, such as the COBUILD English Grammar and Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English. Carl Wieman gave me the impression that it would be pointless to discuss with him the language factor in science. He apparently can't orient to this issue at all.\n\nCarl, do you have the Hwi Lee judgment? What is your assessment of this judgment? \n\nIt is not only in first-year English that UBC is struggling with chaotic practices. Nor is UBC to blame more than many other universities in that the interface between the arts and sciences is fractured. It is impossible to understand why universities do not construct terms of biology courses, for example, based on first- and second-year biology texts, many of which are superior. Such courses should employ as their models corpus methods in linguistics. Perhaps the AAAS could review all the terms of biology and medicine courses in the USA and Canada and choose the least mechanistic and most powerful. If you can find any such course. \n\nTherefore, if America had serious education journalists, at least two of the subject areas--Dvorak, Hwi Lee, arts-sciences interface, English for science students--would have been fully explored by now. \n\nWe see today in the papers that national reading skills continue to register as \"mediocre.\" Well, no wonder. If analytical depth in education reporting just does not exist, you cannot expect improvement. \n\nClayton Burns PhD Vancouver claytonburns@gmail.com",

    "message": "I'm always surprised how 'unscientific' the analysis of race/gender issues is in science.  For instance, the statement \n\"significant numbers of women and underrepresented minority chemists and chemical engineers say they were discouraged from pursuing\"\nis purely anecdotal.  How do we know that white male chemists and chemical engineers were not similarly discouraged?\nThe implicit assumption of most of these studies seems to be that there must be some form of discrimination, as 'proven' by the numerical discrepancies.  This is the worst kind of scientific bias.  I'd have more respect for these kinds of studies if they included other possible explanations.\n  I also object to the idea that strict numerical parity should be our goal.  There is not a single male teacher at my children's elementary school, yet they are not burdened with task forces, review committees and hiring inquisitions trying to establish gender parity.  When will we grow up enough as a society to accept that peoples choices come primarily from their cultural and personal preferences, not from biases in 'the establishment', even if the results do not reflect our intellectual preconceptions.",

Whilst this idea has superficial appeal, anyone with a modicum of common sense (one doesn't even need to be an epidemiologist) would realise that if the birth rate in a country exceeds the death rate, the population will grow in size, regardless of what caused the deaths. \r\nThis distraction about overall population growth represents a particular logical fallacy (a strawman) which I know has been burnt to the ground countless times by your critics. Yet you still keep rre-erecting it as \"proof\". It clearly is proof of nothing. The evidence for a significant epidemic of HIV/AIDS in Southern Africa is quite clear and undeniable. \r\n\r\nDT\r\n",

Surely it can not be called waste, therefore it should not be used as a biofuel. I don't see the need for change, although I understand Petroleum isn't going to be around forever. I see that scientists these days are focusing more on the second generation bio fuels of \"Grassoline\" which is the break down of cellulose, but if we are going to be using all most of the cellulose on the production of \"Grassoline\", where is the ceelulose available for our ruminant animals? The ones that provide us with the crucial proteins required in our everyday eating? Ruminants break down ceelulose and produce red meat, that contains our required proteins. I think a lot a thought needs to be put in such an experiment, before all action is taken place.",

It is my understanding that the nearest comparison to game theory behaviour that has been demonstrated is the behaviour of stock market traders, which is renowned as an unreal environment quite unlike the real world and a game that few people can play well (because they can't sufficiently divorce themselves from reality when large amounts of real money is involved.)\n",
