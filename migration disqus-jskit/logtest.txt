Feedbacks are the issue here, not direct solar insolation which your point addresses.\n\nAlso, CO2 (when \"actually doing the math\") has only very limited effects on global temperature.  The models depend on the secondary effects of water vapor to reach their alarmist temperature increase conclusions.  \n\nCO2 also has a logarithmic contribution to temperature--meaning that it's contribution to the greenhouse effect is largest in the lower end of its addition to the atmosphere (the great majority of heating from CO2 is already in play).  At some point, no matter how much CO2 you add to the atmosphere, it can add only miniscule theoretical rises of temperature.  If it were simply a matter of the math of direct CO2 accumulation, we'd never have had the global cooling from the 1940s to the 70s or during the recent past decade.

When this volcano first started to erupt, I was a little surprised that we weren't seeing a phreatomagmatic event - the heat of the lava coming into contact with the snow and ice causing explosive thermal contraction, and a large plinian ash column and many lahars.  It seems like we now have had/are experiencing this kind of activity at Eyjafjallajokull.  I guess it makes sense that a change in magma type would cause this.  But there's no mention of a basalt-type magma here, and I thought (from my brief readings) that that was the sort of magma likely to fragment into dangerous angular lapilli and ash?  I would have also thought that once the ice and snow has run off from the area around the vent, there would be less explosive activity?  Are there additional vents?  Does a dike connect Eyjafjallajokull and Katla?  Are we now seeing activity based on pressure more than explosive thermal contraction?  I'd be interested to hear a vulcanologist's take on the situation.", "ip_address": "222.153.248.5", "id": "45551408", "parent_post": null, "anonymous_author": {"url": "", "email_hash": "cd6e5ed588fcb50b632a190c2cf7089a", "name": "Marcus N-H", "email": "marcusnh@hotmail.com"}, "forum": {"created_at": "2010-03-17 16:55:35.780148", "shortname": "sciencemagazinenews", "description": "", "id": "313523", "name": "Science Magazine News"}, "thread": {"category": "321701", "allow_comments": true, "hidden": false, "forum": "313523", "title": "Iceland&#8217;s Volcano Proving Tough to Predict - ScienceNOW", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/04/icelands-volcano-proving-tough-t.html", "created_at": "2010-04-19T21:25", "identifier": ["/sciencenow/2010/04/icelands_volcano_pr", "/sciencenow/2010/04/icelands_volcano_proving_tough_t.html"], "id": "87694095", "slug": "iceland8217s_volcano_proving_tough_to_predict_sciencenow_36"}, "created_at": "2010-04-19T22:09", "is_anonymous": true, "points": 3, "has_been_moderated": true}, {"status": "approved", "message": "It would be very tough to manage a mental illness and two parents who are seriously psychiatrically ill.
