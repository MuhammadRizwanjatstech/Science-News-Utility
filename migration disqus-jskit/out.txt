I don't think that electronic nose is enough.
No, Steve, you are incorrect and Benjamin Suslick is incorrect. Colombia is where the coffee is grown and this is the primary mode of identification for any single origin coffee. Or, any coffee blend that is identifying the specific origins of the blend.
One wouldn't call a single origin coffee a 'St. Louis' coffee because that is where it is roasted and packaged. Well, they might for marketing purposes, but it doesn't change the coffee's Colombian-ness.
A friend of mine emailed the article to me. I work in the coffee industry.
I was going to read it until I noticed the misspelling of the coffee producing country, Colombia.
Really?
I'm not an expert, but is not the country of primary or final processing i.e., roast and grind refinement the primary clairfier of significance? Thus Columbian meaning -of or about the United States: relating to the United States, or its people or culture, especially if the beans are roasted, though not nescessarily originated here...Therefore Columbian doesn't particullarly mean 'Colombian' in origin or specifics.

When I tested an artificial nose, it was necessary to "train" it since it is only a correlation. After having it measure a response for "good" and "bad" quality of a particular aroma, it looked like the results were favorable. However, when we tested a completely different aroma, it said it was a "good" sample of the first aroma. It could not tell that the second product had nothing in common with the first. I wonder if tea samples would rate as good coffee?

Maybe this phenomenon is similar to the Synergy Effects described in "SYNERGETICS, AN INTRODUCTION" written by H. Haken. 

correlation does not mean casuality
Hah, I do suppose my "chance" of smoking marijuana is well into the thousands of percent. And yet I don't. Hell, I'm even the prime target! I sleep an average of 2 hours a night, and have hundreds of friends who do smoke, or sleep almost as little as I do.
maybe you should start

precisely
Fowler's description as a "political scientist" says it all.
If drug use issue and sleepless  have some connection, and alcohol abuse then?
"Fowler said his group could see if teens that catch up on their sleep by napping during the day start smoking less pot." 
This correlation will be most likely found untrue, most likely the lack of sleep coincides with marijuana use as a form of self-meidcation. Lack of sleep is a gateway drug.

Sharing distress, stress, problems of friends can lead to trouble... big trouble... that's no real news... and so accumulating stresses and problems leads to symtoms...
Wow, I had like a dozen pot-smoking friends. That's a 504% chance that I'd also start. What is more, having two such friends isn't that hard and you're almost sure to be seduced, too, and then your friends are also affected by yourself. Small world theory and stuff, it's pretty safe to assume that basically everybody did it. Might not be that unrealistic but did we need a 42% formula for that conclusion?

That is a surprising finding -- I would have expected stressed men to prefer more self-similar faces.

But as long as we're telling evolutionary tales, here's another explanation: Humans select self-similar mates to the extent that they have confidence in their own genes, and higher stress levels predict less confidence.  The basic idea is that you're always assessing how you have the best chance of passing on your genes: self-similar mates should share lots of your genes, but then your kids might end up facing the same stresses that you've faced.  If these stresses are too intense, then your offspring might fare better by being less similar to you -- so you choose a less self-similar mate.

Wouldn't it be important to compare female faces morphed with the participant's face to female faces morphed with a face of another man (rather than an unmorphed face), to be sure that stress doesn't simply cause a preference for faces that look more feminine? The conditions that were used conflated self/other with masculinity/femininity...
Well, the first paragraph is a nice example I could use in a logic class of the fallacy of affirming the consequent.
Morphed faces on the bodies of nude women showed to male college students?  I doubt the students were looking at the face.  I hope the authors controlled for classic features of female fertility, too.

Sounds stupid. I always heard that the best sexual partner is the one who is less like you, since the whole point of sexual reproduction is the genetic variety. I know that I don't want to have sex with myself, nor do I want to have children with someone like me, and I am under no particular constant stress.
If it were proving some real point, we'd be all inbreeding happily, hoping that our twins would do the same thing.

The problem with iron fertilization as a means to combat global warming is that there is no guarantee that a large phytoplankton bloom will be exported to the deep ocean, thus no guarantee that the carbon will be sequestered for any length of time.
In addition, algal blooms produce isoprene, the next most abundant biologically derived greenhouse-gas  hydrocarbon after methane. Although short-lived, one of its breakdown products is ozone, both toxic and a greenhouse gas itself. Dead aglae reaching th sediment could also be expected to contribute to sediment methane releases. Surface algae decay will release the organic molecules used by a group of aerobic bacteria that, as a by-product of their metabolism, emit methane (study reported last year).

Seeding oceans with iron will drive up the BOD of oceanic waters and exacerbate the problem of dead-zones.
I do absolutely agree with you
Corals evolved during a period of high CO2 levels and high ocean "acidity" (their actually on the alkaline side of things--saying we're acidifying the oceans seems to be the polemic of choice to enjoin alarm).  Recent studies have also indicated that higher calcification rates occur for different ocean species (corals, shelled)--something that was not anticipated.  The end of the world is still not at hand. 
No analogy needed...domoic acid-producing blooms are typically considered harmful algal blooms when they impact humans.  Different types of harmful algae have different physiologies/biochemistry, so their response to the environment will be different--in this case, iron stimulates toxin production, in other cases it may be the N:P ratio.
Maybe I'm stupid, but I can see an analogy with so called harmful algal blooms (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algal_bloom). Only the phosphorus has been replaced with the iron
absolutely right

This is interesting so, it obviously isn't safe for us to eat sea food. Well depending on what ocean it is, where i'm from i don't think theres such thing i believe this is located in more reconized locations.

or of course we could choose to live in harmony with nature and let it take care of itself.  Humans have never solved a problem that has not created a greater problem in the future, yet we insist on trying.  To paraphrase Einstein, there's nothing more absurd than doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

It's plain and simply time to stop consuming.  We need to reorient our society away from consumption.

I agree 100% with what you said, Vlad. If I had known how much trouble a career in science would be, I would have chosen another line of work. Its too bad, really. I love science and would love to have a career in it, but I don't see it happening.
Vlad, I hear your frustration about job struggles but have to dispute just one point.  You say he's wasting money on all sorts of things but not science, and yet his proposed budgets for all the science agencies are WAY up while everything else is being held flat or decreased.   And the efforts on STEM education are way up too.  So the issue of stimulating, cutting and reallocating science jobs is one thorny question.  The other one is about allocating fixed dollars towards education, basic science research and applied engineering (like NASA).  There aren't simply cookie-cutter answers to those.  And saying it's all political talk and no action isn't quite fair.

Another case of actions speaking louder than words.  Politicians and business leaders are constantly pillow-biting and whining about how the smartest kids are not going into math, science and engineering - but they won't pay for science.  The reason smart kids avoid technology careers is that they are not stupid.  Who wants to go into massive debt to become an out of work rocket scientist?  

Also, many of those 50+ year old technology workers who were laid off, relocated repeatedly, outsourced, downsized, or whatever have children in school and those kids do not see a reason to pursue a career that did not pan out for their parents even if they have the aptitude and the interest themselves.  I recruit for my alma mater, and I hear this story a lot.

If Obama really wanted kids to study science, not laying off 7,000 people at KSC this year would be a good first step- especially since there has not been anything else that he has been unwilling to spend money on.  The dude will waste money on Wall St. bailouts, troop surges, cash for clunkers, and all kinds of things, but not science!  It is OBVIOUSLY his lowest priority.  

To be fair, if industry really wanted kids to study science they would rush out to hire those 7,000 people when they become available.  I'm not holding my breath.  I expect to have a Starbucks barista tell me how the rheological properties of a latte determine the density and height of its foam any day now.

The padding and stiffness of the typical running shoe make this difficult. I've tried it and it feels awkward and forced.
Could you wear shoes and just run toe to heel?

Well, as many diabetics struggle with gaining weight, weight loss is surely not a bad thing for a change. Taking sometimes insulin, sometimes leptin might actually be a good idea.

On a different note: I'm not a diabetic, can I still get some? ;)
The trouble with mudd1's weight loss idea is that Type 1 diabetics, who make little or no insulin, tend to be lean to begin with.  It's the Type 2s, who do make insulin, who typically have weight problems.
