The sum of these two lines results in a hyperbola resembling the hockeystick shape. Some of the last data points of the 20th Century gave the second line a positive slope. This slope was then used to extrapolate into the future. The resulting curve was adopted by the IPCC as a basis for sounding the global warming alarm.\n\nMore recent measurement data points made during the last decade did not follow the simplistic extrapolation adopted by the IPCC. The recent revelations of the &quot;Climategate Hack&quot; have uncovered an attempt by the modelers to hide the fact that the climate has not been following the hockeystick shape. \n\nFor a model to have any chance of projecting into the future it has to have an underlying theory based on fact.  We know that the Earth goes through a number of regular cycles relative to the Sun.\nMuch of the physics involved is detailed in Robert Felix&apos;s book &quot;Not by Fire but by Ice&quot; as well as more recent research studies.  I believe that the Sun&apos;s contribution to the Earth&apos;s climate system requires that the model account for all known components of the Earth&apos;s motion. Since the components are periodic in nature, it should be possible to initialize it to the present day and to perform appropriate calibration of the component amplitudes based on historic measurement data.\n\nWhile a lot of good measurement data has been gathered to support the modeling effort, analysis and interpretation of this information has been flawed.  \n\nIt will be truly unfortunate if the World is saddled with financial and other hardships based on the  faulty &quot;hockeystick&quot; model.", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2009/11/climate-hack-up.html", "email": "braddocks20@sbcglobal.net"}, {"author": "K.Lessing", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/11/climate-hack-up.html", "ip": "76.181.155.200", "id": "1735", "created_on": "2009-11-29 00:57:35", "text": "The behavior of the climatologists in these emails is obviously a breach of professional ethics.

I think that the biggest issue is enrichment of the environment. Psychological care for the animals is not good from what it looks like to me. I agree with that point. \n\nFor instance, a chimp taught sign language should be given a place where he/she can use it and be understood. Space and appropriate co-housing should be done where possible. This last is harder than it looks though, because captive-raised chimps don&apos;t necessarily adjust well to life with other chimps. \n\nAside from that, the care looks ok to me from a veterinary point of view. \n\nThe crashing to the floor thing after being darted? That&apos;s not a big deal, despite being dramatic. Nor is whacking a young chimp on the head for biting. A chimp&apos;s skull is pretty thick people, and young ones can deliver a nasty bite. Whacking a chimp on the head is not like whacking the sensitive head of a human child. I do that with dogs and cats that snap or claw at me too. I&apos;m not trying to do harm them, I just need to assert dominance. It is very important to teach chimps when they are young not to bite. It is virtually impossible once they grow up. \n\nI don&apos;t like primate research much myself, and I know that keepers get very attached to some animals. People cry when a favorite is terminated for a study for necropsy. Sometimes keepers quit. I can totally understand that. \n\nYes, some P.I.s keep themselves in business by killing monkeys and their studies aren&apos;t important. I know they exist. But most of them don&apos;t that. Yes, it&apos;s a career like any other, and inevitably, people that work with primates distance themselves. The same thing happens with people working with cats or dogs or birds or rodents. Rodents are easier, because we know them as vermin. (But in some places, monkeys are considered vermin.) \n\nThe fact is there are diseases and conditions that can&apos;t be studied in rodents or other animals. So primate models are pretty much it for those diseases and conditions. Even with primate testing, sometimes people die from therapies that worked in primates. Without them, more would. We can decide that human lives aren&apos;t worth that, but try telling that to a mother of a child who died from some drug treatment. Try telling that to someone dying of AIDS.", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2009/03/university-of-l.html", "email": "grey-seal@att.net"}, {"author": "Ellen Hunt", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/03/university-of-l.html", "ip": "69.237.118.113", "id": "1216", "created_on": "2009-03-05 13:41:18", "text": "I live with 4 cats. In the past year, I have made 3 trips to the vet to treat serious injuries. (Yes, they are neutered.) One of my cats had his knee broken somehow several years ago. It cost me over $1,000 to fix him. Someone could come into my house with a camera, and by showing just those moments when the injury was dripping blood or pus, make me out to be violating laws. But that&apos;s ridiculous. I love my cats and take the best care of them I am capable of. \n\nA facility with 6,000 large primate animals that fight with each other is going to have injuries. Monkeys and apes do awful things to each other like bite another monkey&apos;s hand right off. They have a pecking order. So, like in the Sopranos (or like my 4 cats), they fight and get injured. If 1 animal is seriously injured per day, out of 6,000, that is 6% injury rate per year. That&apos;s not bad at all. My four cats have a serious injury rate of 75% per year.\n\nBut it would be easy to portray that normal course of events as if it were a horrible problem, and the facility was run by evil people. I suspect that the serious injury rate in Louisiana is lower than 1 per day. \n\nMost days in a major facility it is necessary to round up injured monkeys. It isn&apos;t always easy to do it either, they aren&apos;t all that interested in being rounded up to be treated. And sometimes the keepers don&apos;t notice it right away. A badly injured monkey doesn&apos;t necessarily advertise it is hurt. \n\nThen there are the not so serious injuries that monkeys and apes get. Those are best left alone for the animals to heal by themselves. That&apos;s exactly what I do with my cats. Big-Boy comes home with a bloody ear, I leave it to him and keep an eye on it. Generally, everything&apos;s fine. \n\nWhen treated, monkeys and chimps don&apos;t take kindly to dressings. They can bite out stitches, staples, etcetera. So facilities have inside cages to keep them sometimes. Sometimes a badly hurt monkey has to be put down. That&apos;s going to happen in a big facility. \n\nThis business of darting a chimpanzee that is 10 to 15 feet off the ground &lt;b&gt;isn&apos;t&lt;/b&gt; a problem. Chimpanzees aren&apos;t human, they are phenomenally tough creatures. Their skin is thick, their bones are stronger than ours, and their brain isn&apos;t as easily damaged. A chimpanzee can fall 40 feet out of a tree on his back, bounce, and then jump right up. A 135 pound female chimpanzee was recorded with a &lt;i&gt;one arm pull of approximately 1200 pounds&lt;/i&gt;. Just think about that for a second. How many humans, if their arm was subjected to a 1200 pound pull, wouldn&apos;t break or tear something? \n\nI would be extremely surprised if these tapes are not taken out of context, a smear job by ideologues. What matters in a facility is whether monkeys and apes are treated for serious injuries in a reasonable amount of time. Remember that most other primates have pretty darn high pain thresholds. A chimp, for instance, will run around if it has a broken rib. \n\nThis Travis pet chimp incident is a good example of how tough and strong chimps are, and what they can do to each other. Travis knew the woman he attacked. He was just doing what a normal adult chimp would do to another chimpanzee, it&apos;s just that the woman wasn&apos;t as strong and tough as a chimpanzee is. Travis the chimp was stabbed several times by his owner, and all that did was kind of slow him down a bit. It got his attention to the point that he stopped attacking the woman. Then Travis was shot several times and that made him go into his cage to die. These are incredibly robust, extremely powerful animals. They are not human, and should not be treated as if they were.\n\nThere are legitimate issues in primate colony research facilities, but this doesn&apos;t look like it to me.", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2009/03/university-of-l.html", "email": "grey-seal@att.net"}], "/scienceinsider/2008/12/inside-help-for.html": [{"author": "Ind\u00e9pendance des Chercheurs", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2008/12/inside-help-for.html", "ip": "83.204.254.200", "id": "1117", "created_on": "2009-01-01 08:50:39", "text": "An English translation (except for the first paragraph) of the Le Monde full-page story quoted by this article can be found here :\n\nSmall arrangements between geologists\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zhangjunning.net/NEWS/HOTNEWS/200812/47547.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.zhangjunning.net/NEWS/HOTNEWS/200812/47547.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHappy New Year!", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2008/12/inside-help-for.html", "email": "indep_chercheurs@yahoo.fr"}, {"author": "Ind\u00e9pendance des Chercheurs", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2008/12/inside-help-for.html", "ip": "81.249.79.186", "id": "1118", "created_on": "2008-12-30 06:28:28", "text": "Another story published by Le Monde :\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2008/12/26/defense-et-illustration-de-pratiques-editoriales_1135464_3244.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2008/12/26/defense-et-illustration-de-pratiques-editoriales_1135464_3244.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nreports that the French editors concerned by this affair were allegedly trying to counter an &quot;Anglo-Saxon omnipotence&quot; in world science (sic!). \n\nThis does not seem very serious, as IPGP is a very influential institution.", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2008/12/inside-help-for.html", "email": "indep_chercheurs@yahoo.fr"}, {"author": "Ind\u00e9pendance des Chercheurs", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2008/12/inside-help-for.html", "ip": "81.249.79.186", "id": "1119", "created_on": "2008-12-30 02:57:11", "text": "In our opinion, there is a more general problem in nowadays scientific institutions, and even more globally, concerning the appearance of impartiality and the independence of assessment and review activities, reports on key issues, decisions on funding...

The planet is now at the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic. \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;We are at the earliest days of the pandemic;\u00e2&#x20AC;? She told it Level six[1].\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201D; Level six   means top level on WHO six-point scale, but  of course not in any way, that we are facing the end of the world by the H1N1 virus, neither the virus is  changing in the behavior or its genome. It indicates sustained community-level outbreaks in two or more countries [evidence of community spread are now in Australia, the United Kingdom and Chile] in one other WHO regions beyond initial community spread in one WHO region. The term pandemic reflects only the geographic spread of a new disease, not its severity. Pandemics typically infect about a third of the world in a year or two, and sometimes strike in successive waves .It is important to make this message clear because [otherwise] when WHO announce level six it causes unnecessary panics. However Further spread is considered inevitable.\nAs of 17th June, a total of 40,000 laboratory confirmed cases, including 167 deaths, have been reported by 74 countries to the global health agency. In Asia, first case was reported in Singapore. In India, already 63 cases had been so far confirmed{in Kolkata-# cases] by laboratory and those affected were air travelers from foreign countries. They were kept in isolation. No death has been reported till date by H1N1 in India. Bangladesh, Laos and Papua New Guinea all reported their first cases, while infections continued to rise sharply in Thailand.  Australia had reported 1307 cases and no deaths, Canada 2446 and 4 deaths, Mexico 6241 cases and 108 deaths[1],  the United States 21,449 cases and 87 deaths. Wisconsin, Illinois and Texas have had the most reported illnesses  and the Illinois count rose more than 500  cases. Other nations that have reported large numbers of confirmed cases include Chile, with 1694 cases and two deaths; Japan, with 518 cases; [A high secondary transmission rate of the H1N1 virus in Japan. among minors and suggest that &quot;the population of minors could play a key role as a &apos;reservoir&apos; for sustained chains of secondary transmission of the virus] the United Kingdom, with 822; Spain, with 357; Argentina, with 256; Panama, with 221; and China, with 174 cases[1]. News from Brazil indicates that a new strain of the virus may have emerged there. Institute Adolfo Lutz, in S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, says it has isolated a new strain, \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;now known as A / Paulo/1454/H1N1 of swine flue . Authorities in New Zealand said widespread transmission of the virus meant it likely had more than 1,000 cases. \nThe Question before author is how severe is going to be this pandemic? Moderate or Severe? If it is moderately severe, for the developing and under developed countries with poor health infrastructure there, and whose populations often have high levels of underlying diseases like under nutrition, starvation, malnutrition, TB, HIV, [like in India where more then 25 cores people are living in bellow poverty line] risk of pandemic and toll of that pandemic is expected to become probably highest. There is lack of information&quot; on the pathogenesis and clinical feature of those with severe complications/ illness and treatment regime particularly who are showing unusually severe respiratory illness. Even in developed countries, the virus can cause severe and sometimes fatal illness in pregnant women, babies and people with underlying problems like asthma, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and autoimmune diseases. Most of the fatal infections reported so far had been in adults between the ages of 30 and 50 years[1] noticeably different from epidemics of seasonal influenza. People in those risk groups should seek treatment if they have a fever of at least 100.4, and a cough or a sore throat. The severity of the new virus does not even approach that of the 1918 one, which killed 40 million to 50 million people worldwide. But even the milder flu pandemics took serious death tolls. The one in 1957 killed two million people, and the 1968 pandemic killed about one million. Seasonal flu, by comparison, kills 250,000 to 500,000 people a year[2] The good news so far is that the virulence markers for the 1918 and H5N1 influenza viruses do not appear in the H1N1 strain\n\n No vaccine yet? Vaccine if at all is the final target for pharma industries as preventive one, then it must be thinking for a very cheap or  donation purpose  for the low income countries like India Bangladesh, African Courtiers and must not for a billion dollars profit. It really remains unclear when the companies would make any donated vaccine available, given its existing contracts with several rich countries and. Dr Margaret Chan said that a donation of five million courses of the antiviral Neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (Tamiflu) by the Roche group has been dispersed to 121 countries. She expected to receive a second donation of 5.6 million doses, part of which would be in paediatric formulation, which would be distributed worldwide so that countries would have something on hand to deal with the pandemic[1]  Neuraminidase cleaves sialic acid residues on the cellular receptor that bind the newly formed virions to the cell and to one another, enabling infection to spread to new host cells and ongoing infection to be established. The neuraminidase inhibitors mimic neuraminidase&apos;s natural substrate and bind to the active site, preventing the enzyme from cleaving host-cell receptors, thereby preventing infection of new host cells and halting the spread of infection. The two licensed neuraminidase inhibitors, zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu), have though  toxicity but are effective against all neuraminidase subtypes and, therefore, against all strains of influenza virus.   But resistance with antiviral oseltamivir (Tamiflu) already noted and spreading.H1N1 viruses containing the His274Tyr resistance mutation became widespread beginning with the 2007\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C;2008 influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere, with a prevalence of about 10% in the United States and about 25% in Europe (except for an astonishing prevalence of about 70% in Norway). These resistant viruses then predominated during the Southern Hemisphere&apos;s 2008 influenza season. In the United States today, H1N1 is the dominant circulating strain and is virtually 100% oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 viruses can cause serious complications, and recent data from Norway&apos;s 2007\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C;2008 influenza season suggest that patients infected with the resistant virus may be more likely to develop pneumonia or sinusitis than those infected with wild-type virus, although this finding did not reach statistical significance. Could a resistant strain of H3N2 influenza \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201D; the virus more commonly associated with death \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201D; persist and be transmitted like the current H1N1 strain? In principle, it could, although it would most likely result from different resistance mutations on a different genetic background, given the structural differences between N1 and N2 neuraminidases. These differences mean, for example, that the His274Tyr mutation disrupts the oseltamivir-binding site on N1 but not on N2 and that the Arg292Lys mutation confers more resistance on N2 than N1.We cannot yet anticipate the precise combination of mutations that might enable fitness and persistence of a neuraminidase-inhibitor\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C;resistant H3N2 strain[3].  However No resistance cases Reported in India Yet.\nThere must be restrictions on travel, or border controls, at stopping spread, and  dr. chan called for countries to abstain from trade bans.\nReferences\n1)World Health Organization declares A (H1N1) influenza pandemic by John Zarocostas BMJ 2009;338:b2425\n2 By DONALD G.

I believe technology can heavily influence the presentation of math and science in K-12 education.  In my opinion, depth of understand relies heavily on a solid foundation in basic concepts and early introduction of technological tools can sometimes muddy the basic concepts being presented.  For example, knowing how to solve math problems on a calculator can give a false sense of understanding.

The data used were yearly averages, which was well explained both in the original paper and the 2008 AGU presentation. Just didn&apos;t see any RealClimate people at the presentation. But they knew about it. I informed them.\nThe following is what I perceived as personal intimidation and a threat to call my USGS supervisor for doing this study. The only reason someone uses words like &quot;Does your boss know what your doing&quot; in the context of this event is a threat to get you FIRED if you don&apos;t cease and desists. Now if the study and theory were not plausible and a potential explanation of global temperature variability, then why would RealClimate.org do what they did in their posts?

From here it is a slippery slope towards consolidation and corporate control of &apos;public&apos; fish resources. Society need not alienate &apos;our&apos; public trust property to individual entities to enjoy the benefits of a market system.\n\nGovernment should develop a fish resource allocation framework that asserts public ownership. Government should lease access to fish stocks - akin to other natural resources such as oil and gas. These leases can be structured to favor small eco-friendly fishermen working independently or in community-based associations. Funds generated from leasing can be funneled back into better management and habitat improvement - say restoring salmon rivers.\n\nThe Environmental Defense Fund (doublespeak title for a corporate privatization lobby group) has lead the push for catch-shares. In sync with the World Bank, Wal-mart and other likely suspect their agenda is clear - corporate enclosure of the ocean for private profit.\n\nTo be clear, wild fish stocks of the United States are a public trust resource - basically you part-own them. Government manages this &apos;public trust&apos; resource on your behalf. Their role is to determine ecologically sustainable harvest levels, and then allocate fish harvesting privileges - &quot;share the fish&apos; - in a fair and equitable manner.\n\nUnfortunately, when it come to &apos;sharing the fish&apos; broad community values and expectations of good management are very rarely front and centre. Self-interest and expediency - regularly papered over with bogus economic analysis - too often displace the common good.\n\nNOAA and those that are push catch-shares present the public with a disingenuous characterization of fishery management problems and the solutions available. \n\nThese elements have forced the notion that a policy dichotomy exists: a choice between completely fictitious unregulated fisheries (all U.S. fisheries are now heavily regulated) leading to a &quot;tragedy of the unmanaged commons&quot; situation, or a quasi-private property regime = catch-shares.\n\nThe National Marine Fisheries Service has not challenged or attempted to clarify this inaccurate characterization, nor developed guidelines to guide the design of catch-share programs to minimize harm to coastal communities and marine ecosystems. \n\nCatch-shares (also titled individual fishing quota programs IFQs) are an economic allocation tool not a conservation tool. It is the total allowable catch (TAC) - the harvest cap - that is responsible for ending over-fishing, not the way the TAC is divided and allocated. If a TAC is set above biological limits, over-fishing will still occur - even under an catch-share program.\n\nThis critical distinction was pointed out in the National Research Council (1999) report Sharing the Fish: &apos;...IFQs are not primarily a biological conservation tool; the TAC and other management measures are the main conservation tools in IFQ-managed fisheries.&apos;&apos;\n\nLubchencho should be looking at ways to &apos;share the fish&apos; in a fair and equitable manner. Unfortunately, as a former EDF board member it is no surprise that she favors corporate control of a public asset rather than a management regime that operates in the public interest. We must demand public control of public resources such as fish - for food security, for the health of coastal economies, and for the future of a healthy ocean environment.

Of course, everyone knows that, when describing someone with particular acute vision, we say they&apos;re &quot;squid-eyed&quot;, no?\n\nTo answer your original question, it&apos;s a rather technical topic, so I refer you to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v13/i1/retina.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v13/i1/retina.asp&lt;/a&gt; for the whole enchilada. In summary, it has to do with protecting the retina and the photoreceptor &quot;machinery&quot; from damage by light waves. Unlike or supposed water-bound cousins, we are subjecting to a much wider range of light sensitivity, and so the eye must be constructed with its most sensitive parts far away from direct light. \n\nI don&apos;t know if you noticed, but down under (the water) it gets mighty dark pretty fast. Squid and octupi don&apos;t have nearly as much light to worry about.\n\nIn addition, for all their &quot;correctness&quot; in optical wiring, these sea-dwellers merely &quot;approach&quot; the vision capability of humans, and are believed to be color blind. So much for their supposed optical advantage.\n\nLooks like the Creator knew what He was doing after all.

I will answer your question about mutations the same way god supposedly answers prayers: yes, no, and wait.\n\nYES! There HAVE been human mutations in the last 300 (1000) years. Even in the last 100. How about the wolf boys who grow hair over their entire face? Double jointed people who are insanely flexible? Sixth fingers? Savants who can recite pi to thousands of decimal places? Eight foot tall basket ball players? Chileans with increased heart size?\n\nNO! In a sense, we have protected ourselves from the driving force behind evolution: natural selection. When we live in a society that provides for all of our needs, there is no longer a survivalist advantage to many of these mutations. Often it works against the individual in terms of potential reproduction... \n\nWAIT! Asking about mutations in the last 1000 years is silly. It&apos;s like placing a jug of milk on the counter, waiting 30 minutes, then concluding that milk will not go bad if left unrefrigerated. Your time scales are waaaaay off. \n\nBack to the probability question. The events P1, P2, ..., PN are not independent. Future mutations DEPEND on past ones. It is MUCH MUCH more likely for a human to be born with a sixth finger than it is for a paramecium to do the same. So there is a flaw in your assumptions.\n\nSpeaking of the probability, I&apos;ll admit that I just pulled the number 10^-10 out of my ass, but I suspect you did the same in refuting it...\n\nNow, we CAN observe evolution in other species. Ever wonder why you need a new flu shot every year? Because the flu virus (and other diseases) mutate in such a way as to become resistant to our medication. Hmmm, a mutation that improves the chances of survival, catches on and spreads through the entire species. What does that sound like to you?\n\nEvolution is a byproduct of natural selection. However, it can also be caused by artificial selection. Take dogs. It is quite clear that humans can guide changes in dogs by selective breeding. Not just cross breeding, but breeding for particular traits and behaviors. Greyhounds are fast, pit bulls are tough, and blood hounds can smell like crazy. These things didn&apos;t happen by accident, of course; we guided these changes. But if we can accomplish this, simply by selective breeding (no funny business), what&apos;s to say that, given hundreds of millions of years, similar changes couldn&apos;t occur by natural selection?", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2009/01/louisiana-creat.html", "email": "ericaddison2000@hotmail.com"}, {"author": "x y", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/01/louisiana-creat.html", "ip": "89.216.23.81", "id": "1143", "created_on": "2009-01-23 02:47:36", "text": "EASports  - We are talking about mutation that brings us some new functionality (not cancer)... and the probability is being calculated based on statistics.

In general, a microcapsule has a capsule core including active pest-control ingredients and diluents, and a capsule shell which physically separates the capsule core from the surrounding medium. Diluents are arranged to entrap active ingredients therein and to provide resistance to mass transfer of the active ingredients therethrough. The capsule shell generally includes the shell pores and provides additional resistance to mass transfer of the active ingredient therethrough. Diluents are selected from a class of material such that the mass transfer resistances existing in the capsule core and/or capsule shell depend on the temperature of the surrounding medium.\n\n23. Microcapsule according to claim 21, wherein said capsule shell is formed by condensation of formaldehyde with at least one of urea and melamine.\n\nAnd last, but not least I wish to reference the Netherlands, Institute of Food Safety report that was written in 2006 which clearly indicates that the ENVIRONMENTAL RELEASE OF CERTAIN GENETICALLY ENGINEERED (GE) ORGANISMS and natural organisms (or of natural origin) for the purpose of plant disease and/or insect control is being found to not be as safe as had been expected with regard to human health and the environment.\n\nWhy in the world would the EPA have any concerns of the above microorganisms being in ANY biocontrol product?\n\nWhat is being deemed as being a safer and environmentally friendly form of insect and disease control compared to \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;chemicals\u00e2&#x20AC;? should raise a question in everyone\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;s mind. Of course, time will tell, won\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;t it? Unfortunately, when the damage is done it is just that, done. There is going to be no turning back.\n\nAnd for the readers information; the following bio-control products ARE listed by the EPA as being \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;chemicals\u00e2&#x20AC;?.

A bit hard to secure ongoing operational funding past 2012 when Lamb was expressly forbidden, by the board, from talking to the Commonwealth Govt, the only logical source for such funding. Some would argue that the Foundation Investors, consortia of Universities, CSIRO, ANSTO and other research institutes plus NZ Govt, would re-up with dollars after their first 5 year committment. Somehow I doubt it. Not without a complete re-working of governance at the AS and clear evidence of major funding input and oversight by the Commonwealth. The AS Board has shown little interest in engaging with the Foundation Investors for the most part.\n\nApologies if this comes twice - page seemed to reject initial posting.\n\nWe agree wholeheartedly with CA Sweeney. Lamb was a scapegoat. Two VAGO audits containing criticisms that the board should worry about, plus clear evidence that the board ignored SAC advice re developing funding strategies as long as 18 months ago meant that someone had to go in order to deflect responsibility away from the board.

Not intentional, I assure you.\n\nOn point 1, yes it would be interesting.  Not many I suspect.\n\nOn Point 2, please read my comment again about the dysfunctional culture at the synchrotron.  This is the fault of the senior management, not of the board.\n\nOn point 3, You are incorrect about the scientists having removed their work to rule.  On Friday 11th December the beamline scientists sent a letter to the board informing them that:\n\n&quot;the Scientific staff have decided to (again) work to rule. (They) will re-evaluate their position with respect to working to rule when (their) grave concerns are being adequately addressed.&quot;\n\nThis was in response to Catherine Walters&apos; meeting with staff on Wednesday 9th December where she explained that their inability to divulge the reasons behind the decision to end Professor Lamb&apos;s position was due to &quot;privacy reasons&quot; but that they had fully explained the reasons to the University of Melbourne.  She also explained amongst other things that the structure was ultimately up to the government and investors.\n\nI agree with your comment about a government scared shitless to do anything.\n\nOn point 4, you forget that not everyone at the synchrotron is a scientist.  There are also engineering staff, many of whom have worked extensively in private industry and who are aware that to make such a complex technical environment work efficiently requires professional work practices.  Morale is suffering amongst the engineering staff because the beamline scientists continually demand that engineering work be done their way, even though most of them have little or no professional engineering experience.  The synchrotron would not be amongst the best in the world if it had been built the way the beamline scientists want to work.\n\nHaving said all that though, I would much prefer that the board would come clean and explain the real reasons why they removed Rob Lamb.  I expect that this will never happen though and that as some point in the future the government will step in and remove Catherine Walters.

Especially for someone as &quot;sick and tired&quot; as yourself.\n\n1. Point is well made.  Still, having never worked with Professor Lamb, it&apos;d be hard to know but we have  the reaction of his peers and his staff to see how they viewed him as a leader.  It&apos;d be interesting to see if Mrs Walters were to be terminated by the government, how many people would go into protest.\n\n2. I suspect the reason for the non-action by senior management is due more to the fact they&apos;d like to do protest too but by virtue of their positions, can&apos;t.  Afterall, that&apos;s what senior management is there for. To act as a facilitator between the board and the staff on the ground in times of dispute.\n\n3. Hardly childish.  They made their intentions known and have since removed the &quot;work to rule&quot; order.  They have also mentioned that they will be looking for alternative methods of expressing their frustration.\n\nI suspect you will have to be able to tell the difference between unreasonable and a protest.  They haven&apos;t quite formed a picket line have they?  So would you call the protesting public unreasonable simply because they didn&apos;t see eye to eye with world leaders?  Their actions have so far been within reason.\n\nIf anyone has been unreasonable and un-accountable, it would have to be Mrs Walters and her board.  No comment and no avenue for discussion.  The structure of the facility here is at fault, since the shareholders are organisations who in each board probably have differing views of what&apos;s happened.  So really nobody can take the board to task.  So if Staff are answerable to Professor Lamb and his management and they in turn are answerable to Mrs Walters and the board, who are they answerable to?   Too many organisations who have differing opinions due to their  individual interests and a government scared shitless to do anything.\n\n4. I doubt you&apos;re actually right about the real reasons for the drop in morale.  The culture is different in a Science facility as opposed to a business organisation.  Growth in businesses is seen by bottom line  profit.  The scientists there view their performance in terms of the amount of cutting edge science they have been performing.  So despite them now establishing themselves as a leading facility,  none of the board have recognized the scientific index they&apos;ve improved in the short time they&apos;ve been running.  Until this confusion in the structure and measure of performance index, working at other world class facilities who will recognise their performance will seem more appealing.\n\nWe need the board to come out and clearly spell out the reasons for the director&apos;s removal.  It&apos;s simple accountability.  Until the synchrotron staff find out the real reasons for this, it&apos;ll always be hanging over the board that they merely were looking for a scape goat...

Perhaps the title of Scientist is more apt.  From his statement:\n\n&quot;We were running at one per cent below budget in the past year, have raised in conjunction with the science community almost $55 million in 2009 alone and are successfully meeting the research needs of both the national and international science community.&quot;\n\nHe seems to be doing rather well in his role.  No member of the board has refuted this.  If he was really incompetent, the board would probably chime in here.\n\nSo what could have irked the board so deeply to remove Professor Lamb?\nMake no mistake folks, this Lamb was pushed.  He was reported to have been given 5 minutes notice and &quot;escorted from the premises&quot;.\nSerious stuff!\nThe only people who get &quot;escorted&quot; are prisoners and people accused of impropriety.\n\nHowever to date, the board still don&apos;t want to say why they removed him.  More so that it was reported as a unanimous decision!\n\nEven his own synchrotron staff are up in arms and &quot;working to rule&quot;.  Surely if the board made such a &quot;unanimous decision&quot;. they should have had a reason which they could at least inform the staff at the facility so all this could return the facility to some kind of normality.\n\nBut no, they still say nothing due to as Mrs Walters put it &quot;due to legal reasons&quot;.  A Lawyer playing her own game.  Surely she must realise her own peers are watching her.\n\nStill silence from the board!  She was once reported as being &quot;the first to open debate and does her home work&quot;. This silence though is now deafening and does come across as the board &quot;buying&quot; time to find something.  I&apos;d have my money on Mrs Walter pouring over ALL of Professor Lamb&apos;s expenses right now or even trying to find if he took a toilet role or some stationary back with him.  Or perhaps if he had bought a bottle of champagne while on expenses.  She must be hoping that Professor Lamb might visit the same clubs as Tiger Woods.\n\nThere is a saying that &quot;When you&apos;re in a hole, quit digging&quot;  The board keep on digging.  Each day that passes with no comment, the hole gets deeper.\n\nThe biggest clown though to emerge from this must be Sir Gustav Nossal.  A man who has a non-extensive synchrotron background (some PhD students have spent more time in a synchrotron than him) prior to this but perhaps due to his knighthood and a scientific record from the 70s which trumps everyone else on the scientific committee has been roped in by the board as a puppet character.   It is pertinent to note that he now heads up the National Science Colloqium which was precisely the kind of thing Mrs Walter wasn&apos;t supportive of in the first place.\n\nGus perhaps thinks he can champion the scientific cause but it&apos;s important for him to realise that some of his fellow scientists: Professor Frank Larkins, Professor Michael Grunze and 5 others were already doing that before he arrived on the scene.\n\nOr perhaps there&apos;s hope for Gus.  Apparently, Gus has implied that the board have elucidated to him the unanimous nature of Professor Lamb&apos;s removal.\n\nGus though is probably a pawn in all of this.  The board needed a scientist of adequate repute to make the board seem credible and where Gus falls short (in terms of Synchrotron background), they bring along Professor Peter Colman.  One of Gus&apos;s own staff at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research.  Now Peter is a frequent visitor to synchrotrons but he&apos;s said nothing to date.  Perhaps fearful of how future funding and project assessment committees chaired by fellow scientists might view him.  And the icing on the cake  here would be, guess who is on the board of directors at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, You guessed it: Catherine Walter.\n\nThis colloquium at the moment only consists these two.  I wouldn&apos;t be surprised that if you look at the rest of the people who will eventually get involved with this &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, would either be scientists of little repute OR those who might not be friendly with Messes Lamb, Larkins or Grunze. Or perhaps those who can&apos;t get into the synchrotron on their own merit.\n\nCrucially only 1 member of the Scientific Advisory Council remains. The chap from New Zealand. Professor Ted Baker from the University of Auckland.  I read his statement on theaustralian and my first thought was, he chickened it.  Delving in further, you will find that board member Dr Garth  Carnaby is Chair of the Marsden Fund who fund nearly all research in New Zealand.  Chances are Ted was just given a simple ultimatum.  Pull out and you may not see a cent next year.  Tough choice? Ted had to do what he had to do.\n\nSo are the board really untouchable? In any other case like this around the world, the government would have stepped in.  This synchrotron however unlike others was built by tax payer money but now through some facinating process have ended up as a company.  Perhaps that&apos;s where the problem lied in the first place.  The board has let slip though &quot;sources&quot; that possible reasons were: No Victorian Logo on documents, re-use of templates from previous years, failing to secure money and slow to pursue plans for future development.  It would seem Professor Lamb is really a crap director or the board are just grasping at straws in the hope something sticks.\n\nFor one, Mrs Walter is NOT unqualified to lead a company.  She certainly has an MBA and who&apos;d dare to suggest anything was her fault? The last group that did so ALL lost their jobs.  She does learn well though, she was pushed the last time, this time she struck first.  Those NAB casualties must be watching with interest and wondering if she will fall over this time.\n\nStrangely though, the Victorian Government have also been unwilling to cross her for doing so may imply some inadequacies on their own part for appointing the wrong person in the first place or even worse the wrong strategy in the first place for putting a Scientific facility into the hands of a commercial business.  I believe the real reason that the Brumby Government have not done anything is that they fear they&apos;ll go the same way as Professor Lamb and the rest of Mrs Walter&apos;s previous board members at NAB.  But surely if the scientists at the facility you drove to get built are protesting, you MUST step in!  Word of caution John, passive politicians don&apos;t last long in office.\n\nTo Mrs Walter, Christmas and the New Year can&apos;t come soon enough.  Hoping and praying that the new year holiday will quell the anti-board sentiment spreading across the facility she leads.  Unfortunately, the damage has already been done.  In 5 or 10 years time if this Synchrotron doesn&apos;t perform to the best of its ability, she will naturally point at the rebellious nature of Scientists defending their cause but no one will believe her anymore.", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2009/12/most-of-austral.html", "email": null}, {"author": "Smith", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/12/most-of-austral.html", "ip": "122.104.52.9", "id": "1820", "created_on": "2009-12-10 20:51:44", "text": "Interesting find, I&apos;m surprised they didn&apos;t do a proper background check on someone who will be on the board of a multi-million dollar science facility.\n\nPerhaps they could hire me as the replacement?

Swine flu if it mutates to something equivalent to the Spanish flu of 1918/1919 (Spanish flu was a swine flu variant) has the same potential to kill humans on an unprecidented scale as it did 90 years ago. The problem is that both swine and avian are constantly mutating into something different. So by the time you have isolated and made a vaccine for the last one, it has changed again and circumvented the old guard and becomes useless. The problem is that this happens all the time and where drugs become irrelevant. The reason, it takes three months to develop an antidote and 6 months to mass produce and distribute it (a logistic nightmare in itself alone) and where on average therefore the vast majority have to wait 9 months for the cure. The problem is that even in slow coach travel times 1918, the Spanish flu which took between 20 and 100 million lives worldwide (there is no authoritive number but where it is estimated between the two), did its deadliest between week 14 and week 26, some 12 weeks at least before the masses would ever receive the drug cure presently. The 1918 killer flu had a very similar circumstance as today, a mild version before the deadly version arrived in the fall of 1918 with a vengeance. The only way that this deadly killer can be stopped therefore, if anyone is listening out there, is through a complete overhaul of modern farming and husbandry methods and to give considerable financial help to those who breed the livestock that we all eat. Basically as a single example, just stop them sleeping with the animals on cold nights in the tropics as this is how the flu virus passes from pig to chicken to man \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C; eventually; and where the pig is the receptive incubator. Simply give them a heater and fuel, a much cheaper option that global suicide in both human and econmic terms as it will be. For the \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2DC;Tropics\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122; are where some of the most eminent virologists and micribiologists in the field say is the place where the killer virus will emerge.The philosophy of not letting it happen in the first place. The drugs strategy is futile and it is only a matter of time before the killer strain that will kill literally 100s millions appears. The problem is that the vast profits of drug companies and the government&apos;s ignorance to the real facts will be the nails in all our coffins. The statistics and potential speak for themselves, \n\nWorld Population 2 billion \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C; 1920 \nRange of deaths \n20mil/2billion = 1 in 100 \n100mil/2billion = 5 in 100 \n\nWorld Population now at 6.8 billion now equates to, \n1 in 100 - 70 million min. today \n5 in 100 - 340 million max. today \nBut, these figures could well be higher, as rapid world transit now makes for faster and wider transmission than in 1918.\nI therefore say lets start now as I have been saying for the past three years and defeat this mass killer like no other by field work and not the futile drugs strategy that will do very little indeed to save lives. For presently we are all fooling ourselves. \n\nIf we put only \u00c2\u00a350 billion into this field work globally ( a small price for the human nightmare and financial melt-down that a global equivalent to Spanish flu would bring),we could eradicate the situation but where this \u00c2\u00a350 billion will no doubt end up alternatively in the pockets of the large pharmaceutical companies with little effect whatsoever. Get real everyone before it is basically too late and I am not joking \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C; force governments to change their strategies from something that is impotent presently to something that will eradicate the problem at source. Common sense really but where currently no one seems to have any. \n\nWorryingly  also is the fact that as examples of other problems on the horizon is that the United States makes only 20 percent of its flu vaccines it uses and my country Britain makes zero percent of its flu vaccines, as all its flu vaccines are produced abroad. When a killer pandemic happens it will be hard for the producing countries to release any before their own people are serviced. Little known but true (Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C; 16.07.09). \n\nI have been stopped from putting these comments and facts out by the media before. Let\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;s hope that minds are fully opened now and that the real solution can be heard and not just the bottom-line for drug companies! \n\nDr David Hill", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2009/07/not-to-worry-ab.html", "email": "drhill@thewif.org.uk"}], "/scienceinsider/2009/03/johns-hopkins-p.html": [{"author": "David Wojick", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/03/johns-hopkins-p.html", "ip": "66.82.162.10", "id": "1224", "created_on": "2009-03-13 07:25:47", "text": "It is not clear that the Undersecretary for Science just oversees the Office of Science, especially since the OS Director already does that.

First off, you need to go outside and experience the weather for yourself, stop relying on news and the Web for information. Secondly, you need to look at hard Data like Satellite Temperature records from the Air and the Sea. Make a educated opinion for yourself and stop being involved in the Media Hype but be very careful what your source of Data is. The more people that take the time educating themselves the better off we are all going to be. But most importantly you need to get outside so you can see what is really going on.\n\nWhen you are forced to spend your day relying on what the weather is going to do you tend to notice trends.\n\nHere in Texas we havn&apos;t had a really hot Summer in 9 years now, they have been much milder but seem to be a bit longer in duration.\n\nThe Winters are much longer, colder, and wetter as well. The last two of reminded me of living in the Northwest where it stays cold and wet for 4-5 months. Even during winter in Texas we used to have warm periods but those days are gone, once it cools off it now stays cold until Summer.\n\nSpring and fall are short lived seasons for the most part making up about 1 month out of the year.\n\nSo right now I am cold and wet and when I review the Scientific Data for myself I see a trend that goes the opposite direction from Global Warming, even the oceans are cooling which is the exact opposite of what you see in the news and political hype.\n\nI will sit back and throw another tire on the fire and try to warm up while sipping my coffee. Between Sunspots, Earths Oliptical/Circular Orbital changes, CO2 Emissions, and Aerosols we can all honestly admit that we really don&apos;t know and the Science is still imperfect. Gore did his research and got rich off of data gathered at the end of a warming period, and then good old mother nature slapped him in the face with 11 years of global cooling. CO2 levels are still rising and now the world, air and sea, are cooling off.\n\nSo I ask you to make an educated opinion for yourself and stop listening to the knee jerk/emotional heart string manipulation you get from todays media and politicians. You will find that common since is not that common and that we are not at the center of the universe, the world is not flat, and we are not in control. Sure we can Nuk the planet and kill all of us off.

The costs are high \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C; as are the risks of storage failures.\n\nHowever, bio-sequestration into wood, by IRRIGATED afforestation of largely-uninhabited, Hadley-Cell deserts (e.g., the Sahara and Australian Outback) could capture about 8 GtC/yr sustainably and &apos;forever&apos;. This carbon could be stored safely in place for at least a century (in standing forest) \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C; and also can be subject to a percent or so of sustainable annual harvest, ramping up to many GtC/yr. The harvested wood could be used as a source of solid, liquid or gaseous fuel and raw stock for organic syntheses, permitting us to leave that much more of the coal, oil and gas in the ground. Most of this requires only currently mature technology, at low unit cost. It does require an enormous investment in infrastructure (reverse osmosis desalination plants and aqueducts).

Citing a 2007 Federal Demonstration Partnership study, he observed that, \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;of the total time that faculty devote to research, 42% is spent on pre- and post-award administrative activities\u00e2&#x20AC;?.  Proposal preparation and subsequent peer review represents a significant fraction of that time.\n\nRecognizing this, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) has for many years encouraged researchers to submit brief white papers prior to submitting proposals.  An AFOSR program manager then can advise the researcher whether he or she is likely to be funded.  (Sometimes, even a conversation or email exchange is sufficient.)  If a proposal is encouraged, its prospects for funding are fairly good.  Although peer review is employed at the proposal stage, the resulting recommendations are viewed as advice to the program manager, who decides which proposals actually are funded.  \n\nVesting such great authority in the individual program managers has both advantages and disadvantages.  On the positive side, it reduces the researchers\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122; proposal preparation burden and the scientific community\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;s peer review burden.  Some argue that it also encourages more innovate, often cross-disciplinary research.  (See, for instance, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122; 2008 report, \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;ARISE\u00e2&#x20AC;?.)  On the negative side, it could lead to ill-informed funding decisions, if not well managed.  On balance, the AFOSR grant selection process works well.\n\nThe burden of seeking research support falls particularly hard on young scientists.  Consequently, AFOSR began setting aside funds three years ago for researchers within five years of having received their PhDs.  The quality of the proposed research has been excellent, and about 9% of AFOSR individual investigator grants now go to such researchers.  The program is expected to grow.

It is not great that our budget was not cut for it indicates that the psychotic behavior of those in office has continued.  \n\nYes, the spree spending by Obama and the current administration may be a great relief to those in science but how can any rationale being condone such behavior when it is but a pseudo short-term fix with long-term catastrophic ramifications for our children and grandchildren.  How is this any different from the issues involved in the housing scandals with banks loaning money to those without decent credit?  Obama &amp; company keep on printing money with no backing and our dollar has become tremendously devalued.  Money that has been hard earned by citizens is doled out without accountability.  Foreign aid, expenditures conducting two wars, maintaining military bases all over the world, and even a disproportional amount of aid to Haiti continues, while our infrastructure is fractured.  The rest of the civilized world is not sharing in the expenses, but we here in America, with a seemingly endless supply of money have our elected officials continue to spend like a drunk on a binge.   \n\nAll of us, scientists and those in every walk of productive life in this country should be calling for every possible action that will eliminate further behavior which is evidently irresponsible and without accountability. Many of you will not like to hear this opinion but it is based on harsh reality and not some Disneyland fantasy.  We should all be madder than hell at how our ship is being run.

All major catastrophies in the loss of discipline in all organizations have been preceded by a general slackness in the command. The old saying that a taut ship is a happy ship is still true. The reason is that on a taut ship the officers and the men know where they stand and what is expected of them. There can be complete dependence on one&apos;s associates, for lack of reliability will be brought up with a round turn. On such ships, all men do a day&apos;s work, not just the conscientious ones. There are no soft billets in a taut outfit. The officers and the men are on the job and require others to be on the job.

We believe that the focus now should be on support for the earliest and most aggressive possible emissions reductions, and do not want to have discussion of our efforts on climate engineering distract in any way from the important work at Copenhagen. \nWe want to assure you and your readers that we take the issue of conflict of interest very seriously and have taken steps to eliminate conflicts:  I no longer have a position, stock or a share of any intellectual property in Climos.  No individual from Climos is on the board of CRF, an employee of CRF or on our group of advisors.  We also have a strong organizational conflict of interest policy that would prevent me from participating in any discussion or decision that would benefit Climos in any way.  The steps I have taken to separate myself and CRF from Climos meet or exceed conflict of interest policies for the US federal government and exceed those for most academic institutions (which allow intellectual property to be held by researchers while actively performing research in the same area) and most peer-reviewed publications (which do not require disclosure of financial interests other than the source of funding for the material being published).  In addition we have not accepted donations from individuals or groups that would profit financially from climate engineering technologies.\nThe scientific organization of the conference is being conducted by Dr. Michael MacCracken through a grant to the Climate Institute.  He has recruited a Scientific Organization Committee that, as you highlighted, is independent.  They are responsible for inviting speakers and other participants, setting the agenda and conducting the meeting, and for developing the report of the conference, including its recommendations.\nIf you or your readers want to suggest further steps to avoid conflict of interest, we will be very happy to consider them.\n\nMargaret Leinen\nFounder and CEO, Climate Response Fund", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2009/11/march-geoengine.html", "email": "dgrimm@aaas.org"}], "/scienceinsider/2009/06/with-more-than.html": [{"author": "cheap ugg", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/06/with-more-than.html", "ip": "59.58.175.182", "id": "1389", "created_on": "2009-12-23 01:24:32", "text": "&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cheapuggsonline.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ugg outlet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2009/06/with-more-than.html", "email": "ztm880109@163.com"}], "/scienceinsider/2009/11/women-bag-top-e.html": [{"author": "Terry Butcher", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/11/women-bag-top-e.html", "ip": "193.203.157.84", "id": "1744", "created_on": "2009-11-28 07:57:39", "text": "Hi,\nI agree that Miss Geoghegan-Quinn appoimtnet was a bit of a surprise.

Such an attitude may be well-meaning and widespread but amounts to reckless negligence.\n \nIronically, the only study they cited for such reassurance is one by Casadio et al. early this year, which raised alarm in the scientific community by concluding that micro black holes from the LHC could survive for minutes or more (see: &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxivblog.com/?p=1136&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://arxivblog.com/?p=1136&lt;/a&gt; ).

One purpose is the production of new and newer particles sub-particles and the other is scattering of those particles (in 3-D space). Particle scattering is a method of determining what sub atomic (constituent) particles look like and their properties. It is using the collision of energized particles to give a &quot;snapshot&quot; or clear &quot;picture&quot; of the particle being studied, whether a proton, electron, quarks, sub-quarks or a whole bunch of other interesting particles. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which was built at the European Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva, Switzerland, using a 27-kilometre underground ring. The LHC will whiz hadrons( protons), which are far heavier particles than electrons, to energies of up to 14 trillion electron volts[1]. Two beams of subatomic particles called &apos;hadrons&apos; \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C; either protons or lead ions \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C; will travel in opposite directions inside the circular accelerator, gaining energy with every lap. Physicists will use the LHC machine to recreate the conditions just after the Big Bang, by colliding the two beams head-on at very high energy. Teams of physicists from around the world will analyze the particles created in the collisions using special detectors in a number of experiments dedicated to the LHC[2a]\u00e2&#x20AC;\u00a6One of its primary goals will be thus searching for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs particle and  the fundamental building blocks of all things. It will revolutionize our understanding, from the minuscule world deep within atoms to the vastness of the Universe . The main SM Higgs boson production mechanism at the LHC will be by gluon-gluon fusion, while the qq!qqH process, or Vector Boson Fusion (VBF), will account for about 20% of the total cross section. Next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections are of major relevance in particular for the gluon-gluon fusion production, with K-factors ranging from 1.7 to 2.0. A review of Higgs production cross sections can be found in.  The particle identified in the title is the zero mass particles, and the particle that gave mass in Higgs Field.  Professor Peter Higgs actually joked that Lederman originally wished to label this particle as &quot;the goddamn particle or god\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;s Particle[1].\n  \n The  Higgs particles could be as light as 78 GeV without however being detected at LEP, while detection at the LHC is extremely challenging one the present authors thinks so. However many of the super- and global symmetry partners of the standard model particles should be easily observable at the LHC. Furthermore, the LHC should be able to observe a \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;wrong\u00e2&#x20AC;? Higgs that is a 300\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C;400 GeV heavy Higgs-like particle with suppressed couplings to W and Z that by itself does not account for electroweak precision observables and the unitarily of WW scattering. At the same time, the true Higgs may be deeply buried in the QCD background. Hopes of finding the Higgs boson are pinned on two massive detectors at the LHC: the ATLAS or A Toroidal LHC apparatus and the CMS or Compact Muon Solenoid. These two detectors have the same goals but their designs are radically dissimilar. \nSome scientists, went to the European Court for Human Rights to try to stop the LH collider being turned on in nov2009[5]. They fear it may create a mini black hole \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C; which would certainly violate our rights by sucking the planet into .The creation of black holes at the Large Hadron Collider is very unlikely according the authors. However, some theories do suggest that the formation of tiny &apos;quantum&apos; black holes may be possible. Will that energy of Micro Black hole be able even to ignite a bulb even?[4]. The observation of such an micro blackhole would be rather a thrilling in terms of our understanding of the Universe as we do feel; it would also be perfectly safe. Black holes always form in the space time when certain stars, much larger than our Sun, collapse on themselves at the end of their lives. They concentrate a very large amount of matter in a very small space. They are so dense that the gravity they exert is such that not even light can travel out of them. However there are  some published papers, published by CERN itself that black hole may be produced in LHC [2].  The Black hole may grow, and then  decay  by Hawking Radiation or remnant of it may remain. Growth and decay of black holes possibly produced at the Large Hadron Collider, based on  previous studies of black holes in the context of the warped brane-world scenario. The black hole mass accretion and decay was obtained as a function of time, and the maximum black hole mass is obtained as a function of a critical mass parameter but there will not be any possibility of catastrophic black hole growth to engulf the earth  at the LHC.[2] .Though the final phases of the black hole&apos;s evaporation are still unknown, the formation of a black hole remnant is a theoretically well  expectation.[3]  Speculations about black holes at the LHC  actually refers to particles produced in the collisions of pairs of protons. These scenarios include large or warped extra dimensions, propagation of matter and gauge degrees of freedom on brane worlds, and a fundamental Planck scale of O(TeV). If the scale of quantum gravity is near TeV we will have a copious production of mini black holes at the Large Hadron Collider. These are microscopic - or quantum - black holes. Scientists are however not at all sure whether any quantum black holes does exist. The creation of a black hole at the LHC will thus confirm theories that our universe is not  4 dimensional (3 space plus 1 time dimensions), but indeed hosts other 10 dimensions too as per string theory. It will be then  quite a spectacular philosophical outcome! In the same way that the theory of relativity or of quantum mechanics revolutionized our way of thinking, discovering the existence of extra dimensions would be a major new milestone in our understanding of the Universe.Many people will  next start speculating about using these extra dimensions for space and time travel, or as a source of clean energy, and who knows what else. It is rather tempting to compare it to the discovery of magnetism by the Phoenicians who could not foresee that electricity and magnetism would completely reshape modern life...  Professor Stephen Hawking had a bet in 2008 for 100 dollars (70 euros) that a mega-experiment this week will not find an elusive particle seen as a holy grail of cosmic science. Rather the experiment could discover super partners, particles that would be &quot;super symmetric partners&quot; to particles already known about. Their existence would be a however key confirmation of string theory, and they could make up the mysterious dark matter that holds galaxies together. Prof. Hawkings told in 2008 in a meeting with BBC.Raveling  the zero mass particle and Higgs particles responsible for mass of all particles in the universe will of course award Professor  Peter Higgs  a Nobel prize for physics we belief, who told about Higgs feild it in 1964[4].\nReferences-:\n1]  Rupak Bhattacharya, Professor Pranab kumar Bhattacharya, Ritwik Bhattacharya ,Upasana Bhattacharya, Aindrila Mukherjee, Srabani Chakraborty, Chandrani Dutta  etal \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;Can the LHC Experiment will prove the existence of Sub2quark particles,  a Zero mass particles or Higgs Particle and there antiparticles?\u00e2&#x20AC;?  comments no 1 of 9 comments published on Nov3 2009 for  the article \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153; God Machine\u00e2&#x20AC;?

Using the equations of CERN&apos;s own safety theorists, physicist Rainer Plaga found that the mass of a semi-stable micro black hole could increase at the rate of 19,000 kilograms per second (see p. 7:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1415v3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1415v3&lt;/a&gt; ).\n\nAccording to CERN-affiliated physicists Barrau and Grain writing in the CERN Courier, Nov. 12, 2004: &quot;the 14 TeV centre-of-mass energy of the LHC could allow it to become a black-hole factory with a production rate as high as about one per second.&quot;  At that rate it would produce in two minutes the number of micro black holes that cosmic rays hitting Earth are estimated to produce in one year - but with a big difference. As CERN states on p. 2 of in its own public safety report  that was linked by Clery: &quot;Those produced by cosmic rays would pass harmlessly through the Earth into space, whereas those produced by the LHC could remain on Earth.&quot;", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2009/11/critics-of-god.html", "email": "robertghouston@yahoo.com"}, {"author": "me", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/11/critics-of-god.html", "ip": "81.174.172.206", "id": "1605", "created_on": "2009-11-06 16:57:21", "text": "IATWalrus, what has LHCphobia got to do with the bible?

So only a posteriori, after tragedies happen truths are revealed. Problem is this tragedy if happening will have not a posteriori solution. Now, in simple terms, what LHC represents is the opening of a new &apos;russian doll&apos; of mass/energy, that of quarks which hold 99.9% of the mass/energy of the known universe and act with a &apos;strong force&apos; 100 times stronger than our &apos;weak force&apos;. Ths machine is to the Nuclear Bomb what he A-BOmb was to dynamite. So the creation of any type of big crunches, quark stars, Einstein-Bose quark condensates, quark strangelets, top quark stars (black holes in the models of fractal relativity, which follow Einstein&apos;s concept of frozen stars), dark matter, dark atoms (bc-tau), etc. etc. is not only possible but very probable under gellmann totalitarian principle (all particles that are possible should happen). This is plainly speaking a factory of quark bombs which is not under military supervision because we haveprivatized after the cold war, istruments of nuclear research and now we market th most atrocious industries as &apos;peace endeavors&apos;. It is an orwellian &apos;newspeak&apos; evident in our wars which are always &apos;peace&apos; troops. CERN&apos;s lousy lies are surprising, because even an undergraduate will tell you that cosmic rays are not quarks, that we never founddeconfined quarks in cosmic rays that to deconfine quarks outside novas aned supernovas only the lhc provides enough criticl mass (density) and accuracy. SO indeed cosmic rays have more energy in their collisions, so it does my fingers typing this but the pc is not exploding. What matters is the concentratio of energy, the &apos;russian doll&apos; it releases and the critical mass. 5 kilos of uranium are needed for an atomic bomb. According to the CHinese National Nuclear Institute only 10.000 quarks are needed to create ice-9 the detonator of mass bombs, cern wil release 10000, many papers prove that negative strangelets can be formed. All those &apos;soft&apos; detailed arguments of CERN to prove nature will break the totalitarian principle and NOT form dark quark matter are surrealist beccause THE MACHINE IS MADE TO FORM DARK, QUARK MATTER and now CERN must deny for safety reasons its machine will do what is created to do. This crazy contradiction arouses from the fact the machine took too long to create and science advanced with pen an paper in that time to prove the machine ws dangerous. And now nobody wants to stop it. The faillure of our institutions, the press, the executive, the judges to resolv this issue is appaling. t has been too easy to disqualify critics, instead of confronting the issue.

Dan Clery has been one of the few to take objective note of scientific opposition to the collider.\n \nThe idea that &quot;the black holes would quickly decay&quot; is based on a theory of Hawking radiation, which lacks evidence and is disputed by respected physicists such as Helfer (2008) and Belinski (2006).  Others calculate that an LHC-produced micro black hole could survive for extended periods and  become &quot;metastable&quot; (Casadio and Harms, 2002). These analyses were excluded from CERN&apos;s safety review.  So was the &quot;3rd Scenario&quot; from physicist Rainer Plaga involving the limited growth of metastable black holes that &quot;emit Hawking radiation that might be dangerous to Earth as a whole or the inhabitants of CERN and its surroundings&quot; (at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1415v3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1415v3&lt;/a&gt; ).\n \nMr. Clery provided a link to an LHC safety review and wrote, &quot;the main argument...has been that collisions of similar energies happen daily...as cosmic rays slam into atoms in the air...&quot; But regarding neutral &quot;microsopic black holes,&quot; CERN&apos;s safety report now admits  (7th par.), &quot;Those produced by cosmic rays would pass harmlessly through the Earth into space, whereas those produced by the LHC could remain on Earth.&quot;  (As in a car crash, the LHC&apos;s head-on collisions result in a slowdown.) The cosmic ray argument thus has been relocated to dense neutron stars which, as Plaga notes, are protected by powerful magnetic fields. \n\nWith the its safety rationales in serious doubt, this dangerous project, which threatens the very future of the world, should be halted at once.\nRobert Houston", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2009/11/critics-of-god.html", "email": "robertghouston@yahoo.com"}, {"author": "malcolm mcewen", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/11/critics-of-god.html", "ip": "82.112.150.204", "id": "1611", "created_on": "2009-11-03 08:06:39", "text": "at the end of your article you correctly identify the principle flaw with CERN&apos;s safety reports: none of the scientists involved are independent of their beliefs, faith and total reliance on the maths at CERN being correct less they fail to justify their own work and careers. \n\nIt&apos;s not just a case of commissioning a report into a project to determine whether the project satisfies acceptable safety parameters that have been determined through historically gained knowledge and experiences, (for example the commissioning of a nuclear power plant), but whether the science and mathematics that underpins it is itself valid: thus it brings into question not the project itself but the mathematical reasoning behind it. \n\nUnder such conditions a report that was to give credence to the fears and dangers would similarly question the validity of the standard model and undermine the very foundations of the whole field of particle physics: thus for an &apos;Expert&apos; to determine that CERN was wrong the expert would similarly determine that  he/she was also wrong\u00e2&#x20AC;\u00a6and confine particle physics to the same draw that the fields of flat Earth and geocentric astronomy now reside in. Clearly such career suicide is highly unlikely.\n\nFurthermore the claim that these types of collisions take place in space all the time is false. Sure collisions take place, collisions take place all the time and not just in space: but the collisions planned at CERN are unique, they will not occur under any currently existing environmental conditions found anywhere in the Universe. \n\nThe collisions will occur in an environment kept at temperatures lower than that found in the most empty and vacuous place in the Universe; this is considerably warmer than the temperatures of our outer atmosphere: where these collisions are claimed to be observed. In a sense it is like claiming the physics associated with the properties of a gas (i.e water vapour) are similarly valid for the properties of a solid (i.e. ice).  Furthermore this temperature; absolute zero, is known to afford some unique properties to materials; in particular metals become super conductors with no loss in energy, thus allowing the high intensity magnets which clad the main chamber to operate and  offset, effectively cancel the gravitational, electromagnetic and nuclear forces that would ordinarily act on these protons. Even in the most empty and vacuous part of space a particle is still above this temp and under the influence of the gravitational forces of the universe and whilst these may be minute, from a relative perspective: the gravitational influence of two protons to each other (0/0) to a proton and the Universe (0/0+); this difference  is infinitely greater and yields the following relative differences:\n\n\tGravitational influence of PP = 0/0 . therefore relative difference = 0\n\tGravitational influence of PU = 0/0+ . therefore relative difference = 1\n\t\nThe conditions under which the collisions at CERN will take place have a relative value of (0) compared to the relative value of the collisions that may occur in space (1); thus when compared to each other the relative difference between the LHC\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;s conditions and natural conditions is 0/1. There is absolutely no comparison. The conditions are so unique as to have never occurred previously or to have only ever occurred once, when the universe consisted of nothing but two.\n\n It is a bit like comparing the collision of two super tankers on the high seas with the collision of two similar sized meteorites in our atmosphere or one with our planet. The former may cause a localised environmental incident whereas the latter would result in an explosion, one so great that the destruction of all life on this planet would be the inevitable consequence. Remember it is the conditions under which a collision takes place rather than the collision itself that determines the outcome. \n\nGiven such it is clear that we cannot rely on reports which are produced by people who have a vested interest in the outcome and conclusions and similarly bases its claims on atmospheric collisions which occur under completely different environmental conditions.", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2009/11/critics-of-god.html", "email": "malcolm.mcewen@gmail.com"}, {"author": "Professor Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/11/critics-of-god.html", "ip": "210.212.2.205", "id": "1612", "created_on": "2009-11-03 05:20:08", "text": "Can the LHC Experiment will prove the existence of Sub2quark particles, Zero mass particles or Higgs Particle and there antiparticles?\n\n\n Authors-:Mr. Rupak Bhattacharya-Bsc(cal) Msc(JU), 7/51 purbapalli,Sodepur, Dist 24 parganas(north) Kol-110,West Bengal, India**Professor Pranab kumar Bhattacharya- MD(cal) FIC Path(Ind), Professor of Pathology, Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education &amp; Research,244 a AJC Bose Road, Kolkata-20, West Bengal, India***Mr.Ritwik Bhattacharya B.com(cal) 7/51 Purbapalli, Sodepur, Dist 24 parganas(north) , Kolkata-110,WestBengal, India****Miss Upasana Bhattacharya- Student, Mahamayatala, Garia, kol-86,daughter of Prof.PK Bhattacharya**** Mrs. Dalia Mukherjee BA(hons) Cal, Swamiji Road, South Habra, 24 Parganas(north) West Bengal, India**** Miss Aindrila Mukherjee-Student ,Swamiji Road, South Habra, 24 Parganas(north), West Bengal, India****Dr. Tarun Biswas MBBS(cal) Demonstrator,Pathology, IPGME&amp;R, Kolkata-20***** Dr. Srabani Chakraborty MD(cal) Asst.

Particle scattering is a method of determining what sub atomic (constituent) particles look like and their properties. It is using the collision of energized particles to give a &quot;snapshot&quot; or clear &quot;picture&quot; of the particle being studied, whether a proton, electron, quarks, sub-quarks or a whole bunch of other interesting particles. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which was built at the European Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva, Switzerland, using a 27-kilometre underground ring. The LHC will whizz protons, which are far heavier particles than electrons, to energies of up to 14 trillion electron volts. One of its primary goals will be the search for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs particle. The main SM Higgs boson production mechanism at the LHC will be then by gluon-gluon fusion, while the qq!qqH process, or Vector Boson Fusion (VBF), will account for about 20% of the total cross section. Next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections are of major relevance in particular for the gluon-gluon fusion production, with K-factors ranging from 1.7 to 2.0. A review of Higgs production cross sections can be found in.  The particle identified in the title is the zero mass particles, and the particle that gave mass in Higgs Field.  Professor Peter Higgs actually joked that Lederman originally wished to label this particle as &quot;the goddamn particle or god\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;s Particle.\n  \n The  Higgs particles could be as light as 78 GeV without however being detected at LEP, while detection at the LHC is extremely challenging one the present authors thinks so. However many of the super- and global symmetry partners of the standard model particles should be easily observable at the LHC. Furthermore, the LHC should be able to observe a \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;wrong\u00e2&#x20AC;? Higgs that is a 300\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C;400 GeV heavy Higgs-like particle with suppressed couplings to W and Z that by itself does not account for electroweak precision observables and the unitarily of WW scattering. At the same time, the true Higgs may be deeply buried in the QCD background. Hopes of finding the boson are pinned on two massive detectors at the LHC: the ATLAS or A Toroidal LHC apparatus and the CMS or Compact Muon Solenoid. These two detectors have the same goals but their designs are radically dissimilar.Professor Stephen Hawking had a bet in 2008 for 100 dollars (70 euros) that a mega-experiment this week will not find an elusive particle seen as a holy grail of cosmic science. Rather the experiment could discover super partners, particles that would be &quot;super symmetric partners&quot; to particles already known about. Their existence would be a however key confirmation of string theory, and they could make up the mysterious dark matter that holds galaxies together.

I was always bright-especially in reading and very inquisitive. My aptitude tests suggested I could have been anything. Athletic, too. But, I wanted to do the &quot;real science.&quot; That was my passion--because it&apos;s inherently exciting to uncover mysteries that are intrinsic to natural phenomena. \nX.\nI got the BS in Biology and got an MS in a specialty pathology degree. Since I always wanted to get the Ph.D I took the tests, and was accepted to one good but very small and extremely specialized (translation risky) program. I was too scared to do it (family was growing). I should insert here that I also had a passion for medicine (yes as a child and before I could fully comprehend how much they make relative to most professions) but my University grades prevented me from being a serious MD candidate because despite having an immaculate high school academic record, high ACT, and nice IQ of 145-155 (this means I was predicted to do very well), I couldn&apos;t get much over a 3.0 at the University because: 1) worked full-time through college to pay the bills 2) was married and started a family relatively young 3) high competition at the University (okay, really I just didn&apos;t study enough but give me a break here it really was shocking hard to do it all). Otherwise, I am certain I would be practicing medicine by now. \nY. \nSo instead I was lucky and got snatched up by a really good biotech company doing development (R&amp;D but more D). I tried to do the Ph.D thing after a couple years in industry. Still too scared. Boss offered a raise to counter my academic zest. So, here I am, doing more and more management and less science every year I work (and more pay but by no means sky high). I don&apos;t know the answer to all these macro science dearth v.s. oversupply accusations but I really do envy people that are independently wealthy. Not because I&apos;m greedy but because they could do anything they want w/o too much fear of the economic realities....Thus, they can contribute to society in whatever way they like, following their passions, at least in theory.\nZ.\nPerhaps there will be a return to the &quot;gentleman&quot; scientist days of yore. We need more rich dudes to privately commission the scientists with the highest likelihood of breakthroughs (good luck trying to predict that). But if they were scientific rich dudes they could actually come up with a scientific way of selecting the recipients of their largesse. If the richest 10% of America gave a substantial portion of their money to research (give to the best scientist they know, invest soundly in the best scientific companies they know) would that make a difference in the \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;demand side?\u00e2&#x20AC;? I guess it comes around full-circle. Business does dominate everything. And, if we have more rich dudes that go into science college programs because it\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;s inherently interesting regardless of whether they become scientists in the classical sense, wouldn\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;t society as a whole make more scientific decisions in the future?????

As an engineer who works on a climate-related satellite mission, I probably feel that more strongly than most, since the unacceptable behavior of these people reflects more directly upon me and my coworkers.  On the other hand, I&apos;m willing to pause and wait for a full investigation to make sure these things were done and were intentional, before I totally condemn them.  Not fully releasing data is no crime, and is in fact common among complicated scientific projects.  Deleting the raw data, on the other hand, is a major no-no.\n\nBut it sounds to me like most of you are less angry about the loss to science, than happy to see &quot;proof&quot; that all climate change is &quot;clearly&quot; wrong.  I cannot say clearly enough how mistaken that belief is among those in the field.  \n\nIn a way, it doesn&apos;t really matter whether or not these guys were immoral, for the big-picture question of climate change.  I&apos;ve made my OWN plots of ice melt and sea level rise using only our own satellites&apos; data for the last 8 years.  I don&apos;t need to know the results -- or even the raw data -- from some small lab in Britain, because I can do my own analysis on my own data. And so can (and have) many others.\n\nMaybe I&apos;m an optimist to believe that much of the brouhaha is just misunderstanding of the emails and usual scientific habits. I could be wrong. Science has just as many crooks and snake-oil salesmen as medicine or business or any other field. The thing is, even if this lab completely made up their data, used their 4-year-old daughters&apos; artwork for their technical plots, and made their scientific decisions based on a magic 8-ball... that wouldn&apos;t change anything at all when it comes to the theory of climate change. There are so many different, totally unrelated pieces of evidence for it.  Even if one of them is totally bogus, that won&apos;t affect the others. For example, measuring long-ago temperatures by tree ring histories (one of the main falsities suggested by the &quot;Climategate&quot; emails) does not impact satellite measurements of modern gravity changes, or even measurements of the long-ago climate via ice cores. So if it turns out that this lab totally made up their data, I&apos;ll be ticked at them for putting the rest of us in a bad light.

As a design engineer, I guess maybe I am more used to developing a product or machine than most. The design of anything- especially a complex machine like a rocket- is a time consuming project with risks involved- regardless how much thought is put into it up front. Any approach we take will encounter technical hurdles and involve risk. It is part of life. With Ares deriving its hardware from the shuttle and garnering so much criticism, how can anyone believe that any other approach will have less hurdles or involve less risk? Sure, its easy to speculate now, but when the design actually begins, new hurdles will appear.\n\nI think that the idea of leaving LEO is grand. However,I am not sure that a Lagrange point holds much interest for the American public. Ares or not- its not the method of getting there that interests the average guy- its the destination.

My best guess now is that those central to the research \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;curve fit\u00e2&#x20AC;? the recent temperature rise of the last century to CO2 concentration and have been unable to explain why the model(s) don\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;t fit the last 10 years.  When a model does not fit the data it is because the model is incorrect or incomplete.  When scientists withhold data and programs preventing replication after apparently being corrected by skeptics in the past it is a concern about their competence.  When the science community allows this due to their apparent influence on the peer review process it is a crack in the foundation of science and the publics high regard for science.\n\nWe (AAAS) have a very short time to launch an above reproach inquiry into what has happened.

The controlling body should include a cross section of all branches of science.

Most people don&apos;t realize this, but every dollar of funding that is spent by the US Government (direct appropriations) requires two separate and equal laws enacted by Congress (and signed by the prez)...an &lt;b&gt;AUTHORIZATION&lt;/b&gt; bill and an &lt;b&gt;APPROPRIATION&lt;/b&gt; bill.  &lt;i&gt;BOTH&lt;/i&gt; must be enacted before an agency can even lift a finger on any program.  Even if Congress/prez enact an &lt;b&gt;APPROPRIATIONS&lt;/b&gt; bill to fund a particular program, it is virtually no more than a paper weight without an &lt;b&gt;AUTHORIZATION&lt;/b&gt; backing it up somewhere.  Many Congressmen/women will get something &lt;b&gt;AUTHORIZED&lt;/b&gt; so they can brag to their constituents, but will never happen because they don&apos;t have the political clout/desire to get the funding &lt;b&gt;APPROPRIATED&lt;/b&gt; for it.  Enough about appropriations law 101...\n\nWhat this means for ARPA-E is that DOE wasn&apos;t able to do anything meaningful (legally) with establishing the ARPA-E program (i.e. staffing, procedures, etc.) until the President signed the Recovery Act &lt;b&gt;APPROPRIATING&lt;/b&gt; the funds for it on Feb 17, 2008.  In fact, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if DOE hasn&apos;t received the all of the Recovery Act funding yet from the Office of Management &amp; Budget, within the Executive Office of the President, which has to jump through it&apos;s own hoops.  I&apos;m not involved with the ARPA-E stuff, but I&apos;m guessing you&apos;re a bit early and it will take some time before ARPA-E is up and running.  It&apos;s the Government after all, which we all know isn&apos;t known for it&apos;s blazing speed.\n\nI would keep an eye on DOE&apos;s website (www.energy.gov) as I imagine they will set up ARPA-E website and make a big hoo-ha about it.

For decades, DOE has been controlled by the Oil and Coal lobbies and insiders, enter the Obama administration. Programs and process which had previously been staged to make sure that alternative energy only achieves a 7% penetration, and no more,  are in upheaval. The most powerful men in Washington have been entrenched in DOE but internal investigations and clear sky policies have shaken their empire to the very foundation. \n\nThe world economy has been based around the trading  of oil and coal since the Vikings first transacted exchanges for these products. Some of the deadliest wars, diseases and intolerance has been caused by the policies around who has access to these materials. These materials affect trillions of dollars of economic movement and certain people and companies will do anything to maintain control of that money and that power. These power brokers have maintained that control for over a hundred years until now! Something happened; a perfect storm of political, economic, science and social whimsies, that nobody could have predicted would occur at the same point in history, shockingly reached a nexus. Now, at a single point of opportunity, the entire tide is about to change, but not without a battle royale that has already begun to spill onto the streets.\n\nSteven Chu and lawyers from all of the energy and environmental committees, the major media, House, Senate and law enforcement groups have descended en masse in concurrent reviews of the connections of all of the players. Charts and graphics are starting to appear that show faces, boxes and lines drawn from individuals back to corporate interests much like the Elliot Ness mob charts that law enforcement used to present as they were about to bust up a Capone enclave. The Loan Guarantee Program, Section 136 funding and other efforts have clearly been halted in their tracks by oil and coal interests, in a highly visible set of delays as the battles move close to the public eye. Steven Chu, who\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;s past work has been funded by the US Government was all too familiar with the process but even his \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;revolutionary physicist\u00e2&#x20AC;? agenda could not have prepared him for what he found when he arrived at 1000 Independence Avenue in DC. \n\nThe White House, Chu, House and Senate activists and a select team of outside consultants are busy reviewing every individual at DOE, their role, their connections and the power structure that exists. Multiple public secondary hearings have already been called by Senate committees and closed door meetings are underway constantly in one of the highest pressure, most intense, most revolutionary efforts to rebuild an agency ever attempted in the Capitol. The other side is not blind to this effort and, while their power has been diminished, they are hard at work to thwart the fix. Every tool of political pressure, manipulation and social massage is being brought to bear. The effort has gone public as the first barrage of prime time TV commercials from the oil and coal industry, in relatively incredible volumes, at incredible cost have started to roll across the television airwaves, nationally, pleading for a new \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;appreciation of oil and coal\u00e2&#x20AC;? and admonishing Americans that it \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;isn\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;t so bad, really\u00e2&#x20AC;\u00a6\u00e2&#x20AC;?\n\nMore money is on the table, not only ready to be spent but already late and delayed, causing alternative energy companies to go out of business simply because they were promised the money , they ramped up to receive it and now they have higher than normal overheads, no money, and an even worse survival rate. So the plan of the opposing oil and coal industries is working, they are putting the alternative energy companies out of business simply by tactical logistics, but, if that money does come unstuck soon; the largest funding for alternative energy in world history will take place and then things could change. Hungry early-stage companies move light-years faster than old stodgy oil companies so it is possible, for the little new companies, even with less money and time, to supersede the old oil and coal giants.

The Large Hadron Collider is a quark factory that will deconfine millions of quarks, the strongest, most attractive particles of the Universe. They carry the Atom\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;s mass, caged inside their nuclei. 99% of LHC\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;s production will consist on superfluid Quark condensates, a new state of matter, defined by Einstein, in which Quarks fusion together, creating hyper-dense, attractive tornado-like vortices with properties similar to black holes. Astro-physicists fear that if enough quarks are pegged together in one of those condensates, they can trigger a mass-reaction that would attract all the other quarks of the Earth, transforming our planet into a dense pulsar or black hole. CERN, affirms they won\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;t pose any danger, because according to a theory proposed by Mr. Hawking, small Black holes will evaporate in a burst of energy, before they can attract the mass of this planet. Yet Mr. Hawking\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;s theory has never been proved and it contradicts Einstein\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;s Relativity. So to prove Mr. Hawking\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;s right, 2 experiments were devised last year: a satellite called Fermi was launched to detect radiating black holes in the cosmos, but it failed to find any. A second test was done, manufacturing superfluid condensates, similar to those CERN will make with quarks; but formed with lighter, inoffensive \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2DC;electro-weak\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122; Atoms. Those \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2DC;atomic holes\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122; rotate 1 million times slower, absorbing sound \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2DC;phonons\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;  instead of light \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2DC;photons\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122; - reason why they are called dumb holes, instead of black holes. So, this June in an experiment at Haifa, Atomic Condensates rotating at supersonic speed became Dumb holes and absorbed sounds. Problem is they didn\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;t evaporate, proving that Quark Condensates, made at CERN, will absorb light &amp; matter without evaporation. Because in Nature all what is possible happens (Totalitarian principle), Quark Holes should happen at LHC, making prohibitive for Public Policy the risks for Earth of a quark factory in this planet. CERN affirms LHC carries no risk, but critics contest neither Haifa or Fermi showed evaporation and the Company\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;s safety report doesn\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;t study Quark Condensates, which were little known when the factory was designed. \nWe are talking of a serious issue of national security, industrial corruption and the first potential genocide of the human race, for the sake of an obsolete industry relic of the cold war.  As science stands today, there is a big chance this can happen, making it the biggest potential genocide of history. That this is allowed by mankind is a &apos;monstrosity&apos; that can only be explained in the present age in which human values are irrelevant to what Eric Fromm called technological values: \n\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2DC;Technological civilization is programmed by the principle that something ought to be done because it is technologically possible. If it is possible to build nuclear weapons, they must be built, even If they might destroy us all. Once this principle is accepted, humanist Values (something has to be done because it is needed by man) are Dethroned and technological development becomes the foundation of ethics&apos;. \n\n Eric Fromm, father of political psychology\n \nThe LHC is an industrial con-cern with little use for the advancement of science. Today those of us who are at the edge of research in science consider this machine obsolete. We are studying, after Hubble proved the fractal structure of the Universe and Nottale explained it unifying quantum and relativity (in what concerns the fractal structure of spacetime) the fractal paradigm in a Universe of infinite hierarchical scales in which big-bangs don\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;t happen. Which means the background radiation can only be created in real time by micro-black holes as those CERN will create, which according to Einstein will produce by gravitational lensing this exact 2.7k radiation, when their mass is that of a moon. This means the Universe is full of dark matter black holes, which have eaten the commonest planetoid on the galaxy, a moon. And so the collisions at CERN will have a big chance to do so with the Earth. Cern affirms this is impossible, but it does so because it sticks to the probabilistic/quantum paradigm previous to the topological/Non-Euclidean/Fractal Einsteinian paradigm, in which black holes are fractals of quarks, the substance CERN will deconfine. Thus, black holes will be frozen stars as Einstein called them. In those models the Universe is a deterministic topology and  reality is created with energy and mass, which is physical information, \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2DC;form\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122; - hence there is not quantum entropy and information paradoxes, black holes do NOT  evaporate but as Einstein explains, transform energy into quarks, mass/information that balances the Universe. In those models the probability of extinction is huge... CERN should be halted for a decade till the theoretical issues prove it is safe or prove the fractal paradigm and put the risk close to 100%\nWhat cern has done is to follow the usual systems of industrial corruption that allow all industrial crimes to happen a priori, and then we realize that \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2DC;experts\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122; are often corrupted, that \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2DC;latin jargons\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122; are the High priests\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122; secret talk to hide that corruption, that \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2DC;AAA-derivatives\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122; turn out to be toxic financial scams and black holes turn out to eat planets and stars, but in this issue there won\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;t be turn back. The easiest job is to \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2DC;believe\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122; on  the Company and voice out its &apos;ad hominem&apos; campaigns against those of us who denounced the crime, voice out its false statements (cern portrays the quark factory as a cosmic ray factory, when we never found quarks in cosmic rays), its marketing campaigns (the god&apos; s particle, the big-bang hype), and print its paid-by articles. It is easy for clueless politicians to take the money of high-tech corporations and the Nuclear Industry behind this con-cern. So now that all is set mankind will live with a Damocles sword for years to come. If you want to see a real documentary on the facts of this concern, visit www.lhcdefence.org. Many lives are at risk, real lives of real people, as never before. Today mankind has no defense because the judiciary, politicians and the press who should check and denounce the excesses of companies and governments are not doing their job of warning the population and so private individuals have to step forward, obviously with far less efficiency as our suits against this company which judges have refused to accept, have shown.

This case was dismissed, on the grounds that the US court did not have jurisdiction. [62]  However, in her decision, concerning decision-making on the risk from the LHC, Judge Helen Gillmor wrote these history-making words: \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;It is clear that Plaintiffs\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122; action reflects disagreement among scientists about the possible ramifications of the operation of the Large Hadron Collider. This extremely complex debate is of concern to  more than just the physicists.\u00e2&#x20AC;? \n\nThe European Commission guidelines &quot;Improving the knowledge base for better policies (2002)&quot;, &quot;commission on the collection and use of expertise&quot; Principles and Guidelines state that one of the three determinants of quality of advice is pluralism:\n\n\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;Wherever possible, a diversity of viewpoints should be assembled. This diversity may result from differences in scientific approach, different types of expertise, different institutional affiliations, or contrasting opinions over the fundamental assumptions underlying the issue. Is it appropriate to mobilise experts beyond the scientific community? These may include, for example, lawyers, ethicists...\u00e2&#x20AC;?\n\nHow then do the latest official  reports assessing the risk from the LHC compare with the EC guidelines on plurality of expertise?\n\nThe LSAG report itself was conducted by five particle physicists. The associated report \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;Astronomical Implications of Hypothetical Stable TeV-Scale Black Holes&quot; was conducted by two particle physicists, one of whom was also in the LSAG report team. It was reviewed by the 20-member CERN Council Scientific Policy Committee, also composed only of particle physicists.   All of the contributors to the CERN 2008 safety review (including the SPC report) are presently listed in the CERN directory.\n\nSo all these 26 were particle physicists. Despite this large number, none were \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;experts beyond the scientific community\u00e2&#x20AC;\u00a6 for example, lawyers, ethicists..\u00e2&#x20AC;?, despite that being recommended by the European Commission.\nThis particle physicists-only advice was then put to CERN Council for consideration and advice to the relevant governments controlling CERN. CERN Council represents the 20 governments funding the LHC and consists of 14 particle physicists and 14 civil servants. \n\nHalf of the Council is therefore the interest group concerned \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C; particle physicists. And the other half is also not immune from possible vested interest. This is because the Council as a whole has approved the prior funding of and building of the LHC. As such, CERN Council is far from arms-length from the project, and may feel a bias to justify its prior decisions of support. \n\nGiven this possibility of bias in the decision-making within and about the LSAG report, the complainants are uneasy because of reference to a basic sense of fairness. This is embodied in one of the rules of natural justice or procedural fairness: the rule against bias (nemo debet esse judex in propria sua cause \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C; &quot;no one to be a judge in their own cause&quot;). \nIt should also be pointed out that  the EC guidelines on the use of expertise arose precisely out of an event (the mad cow disease crisis) in which people died partly because of narrowly-based scientific advice. CERN, also assessing the possibility of events in which people may die, has used none of the EC guidelines, indeed gives no inkling that it is aware they exist, and has produced exquisitely narrowly-based advice.\nWith this background, a case can be made  - and is in the Complaint to the UN - that in regulating the risk from the LHC  CERN Council has a conflict of interest, and is under-constituted to assess such a novel, potentially catastrophic and therefore sensitive risk. On this basis, a new review panel based on best practice for such panels should be set up to advise national, EU, and governments worldwide on the adequacy or otherwise of the LSAG report, and the LHC not produce collisions until that panel has reported.", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2009/11/physicists-back.html", "email": "m.leggett@griffith.edu.au"}], "/scienceinsider/2009/12/help-us-improve.html": [{"author": "Lucyoo", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/12/help-us-improve.html", "ip": "193.41.187.71", "id": "2022", "created_on": "2010-01-19 15:23:13", "text": "Thank you, it&apos;s very astonishing story about this post it might be very helpful for students.\nRecently i needed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prime-resume.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;professional resume service&lt;/a&gt;.

It certainly is possible to make it smell like real science while it is not. This is difficult to disprove, especially if no one has access to the raw data to do their own math. All I can hope is that we have learnt from this epic fail. Scientific data and methods MUST be open to peer review, or it may not be trusted at all.\n\nActually, this ridiculous trend of secrecy has been in this field from the beginning, starting with Michael Mann, whose research (hockey stick curve) has been under fire for decades and whose methods and raw data still haven&apos;t been released. In hindsight, that should have tipped us off.\n\nI would like to suggest, that all data on this subject be brought in the open, re-evaluated and re-analysed by mathematicians and statisticians. Not by biologists, environmental researchers or weather specialists or the like. They have proven not to be trustworthy (or equipped) enough for this research.\n\nOnly after this complete re-evaluation of the facts should we start thinking about ways of solving the problem. If there is a problem left. And I think there will not be.\n\nThe damage these people have done to our economy, mobility and politics is beyond words.

They state that the pain condition is caused by depression and low levels of serotonin.\nThis diagnostic criteria (as weak and unscientific as it is)is rarely followed as many patients get dumped in this wastebasket because their physicians lacks creative thinking skills or just do not care--and the health insurance companies just LOVE this *non-diagnosis diagnosis* because what is the cost of treating this strange but &quot;incurable&quot; illness? Not much. Give the patient some Anti-depressant or Xanax and send them packing.\n\n\nUnfortunately,I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia by an inexperienced Endocrinologist--I had NO tender points whatsoever-- let alone 11 out of 18--yet I got tagged with this &quot;diagnosis&quot; anyway.\nAfter two years of steady decline in my health--becoming unable to work or attend grad school, I saw a good doctor--had many tests the other doctor never even bothered to order.I had  my serotonin levels checked and they were not low or even medium range--but at the HIGH end of the normal range--I am a petite and thin woman--my body had no shortage of serotonin!

So, lets talk science!\n\n1) Medical research frequently does not meet the criteria of science. It does produce useful results in many cases, but since many medical researchers do not have a scientific background (e.g. have no PhD.) the quality of their &quot;research&quot; varies widely.\n\nDespite the fact I am neither an MD nor a Scientist, I am well enough educated to see flaws in many of these studies and my friends and family who are scientists have confirmed this impression for me.\n\nI am a Lyme patient and as such I do wish to see good science done on this topic.\n\n2) The core hypothesis in the post-Lyme side of this debate is the assertion that after &quot;treatment&quot; the symptoms of Lyme Disease cease to be caused by a borrelial and co-infections and instead are caused by a hypothetical non-infectious &quot;post lyme syndrome&quot; proposed by proponents of this hypothesis.\n\n3) Extraordinary hypotheses require extra ordinary proof. For example a Hypothesis that Lyme the disease infectious agent(s) becomes harder to treat (or even impossible to treat) after initial &quot;treatment&quot; would require quite little proof versus the &quot;post lyme&quot; hypothesis that claims the entire nature of the disease changes from an infectious process to some other cause.\n\n4) One cannot prove the absence of something. For example, one cannot prove that earth is the only planet in the Universe that has life. The best we can conclude is that despite some degree of effort we have not been able to prove their is life on other planets.\n\nThus it is not possible to prove that any treatment has eliminated Borrelial and co-infections from the body.\n\nThen again, there is a wide body of evidence that many treatments do NOT eliminate Borrelial infection and be cultured from such treated people.\n\n5) The principal of &quot;Parsimony,&quot; or Occam&apos;s Razor will be recognized by the scientists reading this post. As you know, this is the principle that all other things being equal, the simplest explanation is preferred on this basis.\n\nTherefore, the simple notion that an infection might persist beyond treatment clearly is preferred to some complex post-infection explanation.\n\nGiven the impossibility of proving a lack of infection, this means the bar is quite high for proponents of other theories. The exact mechanism would need to be known and would need to explain and predict features of the disease before such a theory could begin to compete on equal *scientific  * basis to the persistent infection theory.\n\nSo, to conclude, the scientific part of this debate is easy: the persistent infection theory is without a doubt the winner given what we know.\n\nNow, regarding &quot;treatment studies&quot;. These studies can and should be done on the basis of finding the best treatments for patients. The great debate should have no bearing whatsoever on treatment studies.\n\nTreatment studies in fact cannot prove or disprove the above debate in any case.  However, given the facts I have enumerated, and the conclusion that persistent infection is the hands down winner so far, treatment studies must include anti-microbial treatment.\n\nThey must compare different anti-microbial treatments and determine which is best - leaving infected individuals untreated is both unethical and goes against the science of this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRolf Taylor\nCleveland Hts, OH", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2008/11/lyme-disease-ta.html", "email": "rolf.taylor@yahoo.com"}, {"author": "--", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2008/11/lyme-disease-ta.html", "ip": "96.244.133.134", "id": "1101", "created_on": "2008-12-02 22:20:03", "text": "Arthritis Rheum. 2008 Nov 26;59(12):1742-1749. \nRole of psychiatric comorbidity in chronic Lyme disease.\n\nHassett AL, Radvanski DC, Buyske S, Savage SV, Gara M, Escobar JI, Sigal LH.\nUniversity of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence and role of psychiatric comorbidity and other psychological factors in patients with chronic Lyme disease (CLD). METHODS: We assessed 159 patients drawn from a cohort of 240 patients evaluated at an academic Lyme disease referral center. Patients were screened for common axis I psychiatric disorders (e.g., depressive and anxiety disorders); structured clinical interviews confirmed diagnoses. Axis II personality disorders, functional status, and traits like negative and positive affect and pain catastrophizing were also evaluated. A physician blind to psychiatric assessment results performed a medical evaluation. Two groups of CLD patients (those with post-Lyme disease syndrome and those with medically unexplained symptoms attributed to Lyme disease but without Borrelia burgdorferi infection) were compared with 2 groups of patients without CLD (patients recovered from Lyme disease and those with an identifiable medical condition explaining symptoms attributed to Lyme disease). \nRESULTS: After adjusting for age and sex, axis I psychiatric disorders were more common in CLD patients than in comparison patients (P = 0.02, odds ratio 2.64, 95% confidence interval 1.30-5.35), but personality disorders were not.

As stated above, it&apos;s purely scientific fraud by insiders working with pharmaceutical companies and/or with their own financial interests in the disease. As background, in 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court said that researchers could patent, and thus &quot;own&quot; microoganism that they discovered. The organism that causes Lyme disease was discovered in 1982. And, around that time, during the Reagan era, Congress loosened restrictions on universities and researchers being permitted to get money from the patents issues to them through federal funding. (This was called the Bahy-Dole Act.) These changes by the US Sct and by Congress have set the stage for the greed, and the lies told in service of greed exemplified by the IDSA guidelines. As part of the Congressional legislation, the universities were supposed to &quot;manage&quot; the conflicts of interest by the researchers, but they have essentially abdicated their responsibility. Just take a look at recent stories in the New York Times on the work of Senator Grassley, and the failure of prominent physicians such as Joe Biederman, MD at MGH, or Charlie Nemeroff, MD to inform their institutions of the enormous sums they are receiving from pharmaceutical companies.  Although this is a slightly different circumstance (the money is from pharmaceutical companies and not royalties from patents), it gives you a sense of how corrupt academic medicine has become, and how universities turn a blind eye to whether a faculty member is complying with conflict of interest regulations. The magnitude of the fraud with respect to Lyme disease, though, is like anything seen in medicine before ---- imagine, thousands of people unable to get medical care because of the greed of a tight knit group of researchers bent on becoming millionaires! Not to mention the universities that also hope to become &quot;millionaires&quot; by virture of the patents issued to the institution being successfully commercialized by a pharmaceutical company. This money obtained through licensing can add significant sums to a university&apos;s bottom line. For example, the President of Yale projected they would make $10 million a year from the Glaxo Lyme vaccine, before it was pulled from the market. Universities have an incentive not to look too closely at their faculty members conflicts of interest because the universities, also, have conflicts of interest. But this was all set up by Congress. Congress now needs to jump back in, investigate the fraud that has gone on related to this disease so that people can obtain medical care, and then tighten up the rules that apply to researchers and universities. It would be too much to ask that the US Supreme Court overturn the decision that microorganisms can be patented and &quot;owned,&quot; but, truly, is it fair that things like microorganisms, found in nature, not created or &quot;invented&quot; by any person be subject to being &quot;owned&quot;?\n\nWe&apos;ve seen what deregulation and greed on Wall Street has done to our markets.

Patients with persistent symptoms after standard (2-4-week) antibiotic therapy for this tickborne illness have been denied further antibiotic treatment as a result of the perception that long-term infection with the Lyme spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, and associated tickborne pathogens is rare or nonexistent. \n\nMETHODS: I review the pathophysiology of B. burgdorferi infection and the peer-reviewed literature on diagnostic Lyme disease testing, standard treatment results, and coinfection with tickborne agents, such as Babesia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, and Bartonella species. I also examine uncontrolled and controlled trials of prolonged antibiotic therapy in patients with persistent symptoms of Lyme disease. \n\nRESULTS: The complex &quot;stealth&quot; pathology of B. burgdorferi allows the spirochete to invade diverse tissues, elude the immune response, and establish long-term infection. Commercial testing for Lyme disease is highly specific but relatively insensitive, especially during the later stages of disease. Numerous studies have documented the failure of standard antibiotic therapy in patients with Lyme disease. Previous uncontrolled trials and recent placebo-controlled trials suggest that prolonged antibiotic therapy (duration, &gt;4 weeks) may be beneficial for patients with persistent Lyme disease symptoms. Tickborne coinfections may increase the severity and duration of infection with B. burgdorferi. \n\nCONCLUSIONS: Prolonged antibiotic therapy may be useful and justifiable in patients with persistent symptoms of Lyme disease and coinfection with tickborne agents.", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2008/11/lyme-disease-ta.html", "email": null}, {"author": "Karen", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2008/11/lyme-disease-ta.html", "ip": "75.101.22.96", "id": "1111", "created_on": "2008-11-26 00:39:10", "text": "That final sentence is pure spin.

This point of view is controversial, but is becoming increasingly accepted by virologists and immunologists.\n\nAngiotensin II appears to be an early signal in activating the immune response, and inflammation in general.\n\nMedications which block angiotensin II have been available for over two decades. These include ACE inhibitors (ACE = angiotensin I-converting enzyme, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201D;which is inactive\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201D;into angiotensin II, the active signal) and ARBs (for Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers). Nobody taking an ACE inhibitor or an ARB has ever seemed immunosuppressed, so there seems to be no down-side to this study. In other words, we don&apos;t believe that taking an ACE inhibitor or an ARB will make you MORE susceptible to death from the influenza virus.\n\nGenoMed is pioneering the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs for the treatment of viral diseases like influenza. We have recently published positive but very limited results for West Nile virus (see reference 1, below). We hope that we&apos;ll have similar results for influenza and avian influenza.\n\n\n\n\nThe Study\n\nAt this early point in the flu season, we do not have enough information to know whether ACE inhibitors or ARBs will be able to prevent the flu/bird flu or just limit the symptoms of people who get the flu; both; or neither. So it will be up to you, the patient, to decide if you want to try to prevent the flu, in which case you would start taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB right away and keep taking it for the duration of the flu season, i.e. throughout the fall and winter, until spring (May 1st, let&apos;s say). You would do this if you felt that the flu was so dangerous for you that you would do almost anything to avoid getting it. This approach may help you prevent it. BUT IT MAY NOT. WE JUST DON&quot;T KNOW YET.\n\nIf you&apos;re not that worried about how you&apos;ll do with the flu, and you don&apos;t feel that it&apos;s so important that you prevent it, then you can wait until you get it, and then try taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB to see if you get over it more quickly than usual. So the minute you feel achy, tired, start coughing up clear phlegm, or have a fever, you would go to your doctor and tell him/her about this trial. If s/he agrees, s/he will prescribe an ACE inhibitor or ARB for you. AGAIN, PLEASE NOTE: WE DON&apos;T KNOW IF YOUR SYMPTOMS WILL GO AWAY FASTER WITH THIS TREATMENT. THAT&apos;S WHY THIS IS CALLED A &quot;CLINICAL TRIAL.&quot;\n\nWe&apos;ll be following you about once a month by email. You&apos;ll get the same message each month or so\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201D;basically, &quot;How are you feeling? Have you had the flu since our last email?&quot; If you answer yes, then we&apos;ll ask you whether you took the ACE inhibitor or ARB, which one you took and at what dose, how long the flu lasted, how long the flu usually lasts for you, etc.\n\nThe choice of whether to use an ACE inhibitor or ARB is up to your physician. If you already have high blood pressure, then we would recommend a hydrophobic ACE inhibitor such as quinapril, which will soon be generic. If your blood pressure is normal or even low, then we would recommend the smallest possible dose of one of the seven available ARBs, any one of which can be broken in half to further minimize the chance that it will lower your blood pressure too much. In other words, start low and work your way up on the dose to avoid getting dizzy or lightheaded from the ARB. You could start at half the dose recommended below, and after a day or two, if you&apos;re not feeling dizzy or lightheaded, take that dose twice a day to equal the &quot;usual daily adult dose for a person with normal or low blood pressure.&quot; \n\n\n\n\nDrug name  Usual daily adult dose*   Company   Note \nCozaar (losartan)  50 mg   Merck   \nAvapro (irbesartan)  75 mg   BMSquibb   approved for children \nBenicar (olmesartan)  40 mg   Sankyo   \nDiovan (valsartan) 40 mg  Novartis    \nAtacand (candesartan) 8 mg   AstraZeneca    \nTeveten (eprosartan)  600 mg  Biovail   \nMicardis (telmisartan) 40 mg  Boehringer-Ingelheim   \n\n\n*Usual daily adult dose for a person with normal or low blood pressure\n\nYour doctor/primary care provider may be able to get free samples of some of these drugs from the appropriate drug representative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEligibility\n\nOnly people with an intact immune system are eligible for this study. People who are known to be immunosuppressed are not eligible. We do not consider children or the elderly to be immunosuppressed, and they are eligible for this study.

Without the advances in DNA sequencing, the whole human genome will not be sequenced in record time.  Without the atom smashers, there would not be discoveries of atomic sub-particles.  Just look at the Nobel Prizes, they were being awarded to many individuals who developed significant technologies that advance the respective fields.  Just the Physiology and Medicine category alone, radioimmunoassay, protein and DNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), just to name a few, were recognized as technologies that made significant differences in the ways we conduct scientific investigations. So, what is wrong with that? Of course, I am not saying that revolutionary concepts are not important. But, do we have such concepts on a daily basis?  Technology-driven scientific investigations will fuel the development of new concepts and will also propel sciences on a daily basis.\n\nThe mention of Cultural Revolution in relationship to scientific advances is totally out of context.  The Cultural Revolution was something of the past.  I am sure history will have the final evaluation of its merits, but it can not be applied to the presence.

Chinese Asians are hamstrung by their centuries old culture despite the failed attempts to wipe it out with the Cultural Revolution.  The rest of the world besides America suffers from the same relative problem but to different degree.  The key is value placed on the individual, smallness, one&apos;s intellect and innovation and cost efficiency whether science or other endeavors coupled with no limitations but oneself.  Small science, if you will, of no more than five closely working, highly skilled thinkers.  In essence confidence, worth and freedom in the individual.  Coupled with this is missing a fundamental and global value in novelty, going where no man has gone before.\n\nLike the postwar Japanese, Chinese scientists are satisfied to copy, but with a tiny bit of improvement the status quo.  To go along with dogma and reproduce and refine it at the technical level without question or concept driven skepticism.  In fact the simple reproduction of a glamorous report is still a source of pride and bonding, Science, Cell or Nature, even though published in minor journal.  \n\nThe administrative glass ceiling exists because they are content to extend their repetitive busy work to confirm and contribute to whatever is glamorous at the moment by dictatorial management of technial assembly line activity, rather than building consensus and training individuals of concept and hypothesis driven science.  Churning out endless repetitive and duplicative data now gives the same brute force feeling of accomplishment and challenge to compete with the world that drove the Cultural Revolution.  The lure (and delusion) of shortterm profit in the pharmaceutical industry fueled by the endless targets opened up by glamor of DNA sequence and sensitive detection technology plays no small part.  It will have the same end.\n\nIn essence a democratic approach of advise and consent to productivity and training will take many years to come, if adopted at all, due to the above centuries of cultural background.  Compare the features that it takes to be big dog in Chinese hierachy with comparable position in Western organization.  They are fundamentally and totally different and few Asians are willing to analyse that, change and implement.\n\nThat said, the blank check given to the American continent in respect to land mass, melting pot diversity of race and culture and political and economic system in the late 17th century is unequaled in modern history in respect to science.  Sadly, the evolution in science in America is currently away from that mix of factors with introduction of all the flaws described above associated with Asian and European precursor systems.  Technology-driven repetitive data production without hypothetical base or hope of long term synthesis and application seems the synthesis worldwide at the expense of the human race.

I respect KC Nicolaou a lot and no doubt he served his time in the trenches working hard to get high quality publications.

For the most part, these folks are just arguing about the science. But there are many issues beyond the science that arise when one reads these emails that many non-scientists might well find disturbing. For example, we find the data is not as iron clad as the scientists would have us believe.  These scientists actively refuse FOI requests in order to cover up this fact. Furthermore, we get the very strong impression that many of them are less interested in hard science and more interested in the impression the data ultimately presents. Some readers will conclude that perhaps we need to wait just a bit. After all, if we are to believe these scientists,(and perhaps we should) we are discussing nothing less than the fate of the earth. And then we read these emails...and we have to conclude with these non-scientist observers that we really have to see the original data. \n\nAnd clearly, given that almost all science is paid for by the citizens, can&apos;t we reasonably ask why the citizens should not have access to the real data completely uncontaminated by the &quot;opinions&quot; of the authors?   Consider just how many jpegs would be equivalent to the volume of material that was hacked! Not very many. Have them post it all on Google. People are arguing about the volume but I submit that for all of science it would be a drop in the bucket. \n\nAnother idea comes to mind which might reduce some of this in-fighting. Mind you this is a very radical thought but this is very serious business and we badly need to get it under control  I believe this mess really reflects the long standing need for a major shift in &quot;science publishing&quot; so that &quot;data&quot; and &quot;opinion&quot; are very clearly separated.\n\nI believe, there should be one group of journals which deals only with data--real data. It should be very, very difficult to get a paper into one of these &quot;data&quot; journals. The description of exactly how the data was acquired should be exceedingly detailed. If the data is in fact flawed, it should be possible to reproduce the data to the extent that the flaw in logic or procedure would be apparent. The greatest error a scientist could make should be any attempt to present his &quot;data&quot; as something it is not.\n\nOf course, the devil is always in the details and, for example, it is often the case that scientists attempt(for all sorts of reasons) to make a case by measuring only part of a system. A primary &quot;data&quot; journal cannot stop this practice but it can make it much more obvious that the data is only partial. Many limitations are, of course, very real as in the case of instruments which simply won&apos;t produce data above/below a certain wavelength. Such limitations should be very carefully denoted as a part of the data.  Given the power of today&apos;s search engines, we should never have to worry about overlooking data.  A careful search should produce it all. \n\nThere should be another group of journals that I would consider &quot;secondary&quot; that deal only with peoples opinions drawn on the &quot;data&quot; in the primary journals.\n\nThere might be a &quot;hold&quot; of several months that allowed the scientists who acquired the &quot;data&quot; to be the first to make conclusions based on the new &quot;data&quot;.\n\nThe problem is that &quot;conclusions&quot; are always opinions. Two different people can often reach very different conclusions based on the same data. We need a way to separate the facts and the opinions. Using the system proposed here, popular publications would know if a scientific publication was &quot;fact&quot; or &quot;opinion&quot;. Their articles could be clearly based on &quot;fact&quot; or on &quot;opinion&quot;. Currently even the &quot;best&quot; journals are not immune to politics. The tone of these emails clearly shows exactly how the scientists are really politicians. This is no surprise because they are just people. There is always a reason to take a particular stand. Such tendencies should not be allowed to influence data. After all the &quot;data&quot; is what we citizens are paying for. Politics should influence only the &quot;opinions&quot;  \n\nThis is a very serious issue. We are not discussing something arcane like the reality of dark energy.

Jeff has been an astute observer of Congress and science policymaking for a long time, so I&apos;m at a loss as to why he would so misinterpret yesterday&apos;s event. But I appreciate this opportunity to explain it.\n\nLet me be clear. There is nothing partisan about the support in Congress for federal funding of basic scientific research at our nation&apos;s universities. Some Republicans in Congress have always been among the staunchest supporters of such funding. And it was President Bush who launched the American Competitiveness Initiative and signed into law the America COMPETES Act, which had strong bipartisan support. The research university community has worked closely with both Republican and Democratic supporters of these critical investments and will continue to do so. Indeed, there is a bipartisan House caucus that supports federal research and development initiatives. And the research university community -- along with scientific societies and a large portion of the business community -- will continue working to convince both parties of the need to continue to increase the federal investment in scientific research, even as Congress and the Administration take on budget deficits in the years ahead.\n\nWith respect to the Recovery Act, this bill included an extraordinary infusion of funds into scientific research. It&apos;s an investment that not only helps with the current recovery but more importantly helps to rebuild America&apos;s economy for the future. Indeed it&apos;s essential for building an economy that helps our nation confront the most serious challenges we face in the decades ahead, such as energy, climate, and health. Research, most of it federally funded, is how we will find more cures for disease; and research, most of it federally funded, will underpin the development of alternative forms of energy that we so desperately need; and research, most of it federally funded, will underpin the development of new technologies for communications and transporation and other fields. And all of these developments can transform our economy, much as federally funded research led to the information revolution we continue to experience today.\n\nThe university community believes it is very important to explain to the public the value of the Recovery Act investment in science, and to help inform the American people about what their tax dollars are purchasing. this is what ResearchWorksForUS (www.ResearchWorksForUS.org) is all about.\n\nWhile our effort is independent, we are also working with Members of Congress who supported that legislation -- as well as the Administration. Both the President and the Speaker were determined to include these investments in the Recovery Act. Science is a fundamental part of their respective agendas. Moreover, in the House, only Democrats supported the legislation. That is why Jeff saw only Democrats at yesterday&apos;s event. The event was about legislation that only Democrats in the House supported. I can&apos;t imagine that anybody, Democrat or Republican, who voted against the legislation would have wanted to appear at an event commemorating a key element of a bill they opposed, even if this likely was not the reason they opposed it.\n\nSo, to answer Jeff&apos;s question, while support for the Recovery Act may have come from only one party, support for science is very bipartisan, and it will undoubtedly remain so.", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2009/11/pelosi-leads-pa.html", "email": null}], "/scienceinsider/2009/07/congress-backs.html": [{"author": "Devon Swezey", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/07/congress-backs.html", "ip": "209.133.53.55", "id": "1979", "created_on": "2009-07-08 17:33:36", "text": "Jeffrey and Robert,\n\nThank you for the story.  \n\nDo you know what decision the Senate appropriations subcommittee made on funding the Re-ENERGYSE program today?\n\nBest, \n\nDevon Swezey", "uniq": "/scienceinsider/2009/07/congress-backs.html", "email": "dswezey@gmail.com"}], "/scienceinsider/2009/09/who-simplifies.html": [{"author": "FactChecker2", "url": "http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/09/who-simplifies.html", "ip": "94.65.194.69", "id": "1469", "created_on": "2009-09-25 04:20:22", "text": "Jon, you left out a second significant aspect of the WHO announcement.\n\nWHO recommended changing the current H3N2 strain (which is in the 2009-2010 seasonal vaccine) to a different H3N2 strain, because of evidence that circulating H3N2 is drifting away from the current vaccine strain.\n\nThat underscores the possibility that this year&apos;s northern hemisphere seasonal vaccine (2009-2010) may not be a good match for the H3N2 strain that ends up predominating. \n\nH3N2 usually causes the most severe disease of the seasonal strains, and in people over 65, it causes far more severe disease than the pandemic strain causes in people under 65.\n\nSo if seasonal H3N2 isn&apos;t &quot;crowded out&quot; by the pandemic virus, the old folks may have a bad H3N2 year because of poor vaccine protection against it, while the younger folks are coping with pandemic flu H1N1.\n\nFortunately, there is some evidence that H3N2 may be partially crowded out.

The planet is now at the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic. \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;We are at the earliest days of the pandemic;\u00e2&#x20AC;? She told it Level six[1].\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201D; Level six   means top level on WHO six-point scale, but  of course not in any way, that we are facing the end of the world by the H1N1 virus, neither the virus is  changing in the behavior or its genome. It indicates sustained community-level outbreaks in two or more countries [evidence of community spread are now in Australia, the United Kingdom and Chile] in one other WHO regions beyond initial community spread in one WHO region. The term pandemic reflects only the geographic spread of a new disease, not its severity. Pandemics typically infect about a third of the world in a year or two, and sometimes strike in successive waves .It is important to make this message clear because [otherwise] when WHO announce level six it causes unnecessary panics. However Further spread is considered inevitable.\nAs of 17th June, a total of 40,000 laboratory confirmed cases, including 167 deaths, have been reported by 74 countries to the global health agency. In Asia, first case was reported in Singapore. In India, already 63 cases had been so far confirmed{in Kolkata-# cases] by laboratory and those affected were air travelers from foreign countries. They were kept in isolation. No death has been reported till date by H1N1 in India. Bangladesh, Laos and Papua New Guinea all reported their first cases, while infections continued to rise sharply in Thailand.  Australia had reported 1307 cases and no deaths, Canada 2446 and 4 deaths, Mexico 6241 cases and 108 deaths[1],  the United States 21,449 cases and 87 deaths. Wisconsin, Illinois and Texas have had the most reported illnesses  and the Illinois count rose more than 500  cases. Other nations that have reported large numbers of confirmed cases include Chile, with 1694 cases and two deaths; Japan, with 518 cases; [A high secondary transmission rate of the H1N1 virus in Japan. among minors and suggest that &quot;the population of minors could play a key role as a &apos;reservoir&apos; for sustained chains of secondary transmission of the virus] the United Kingdom, with 822; Spain, with 357; Argentina, with 256; Panama, with 221; and China, with 174 cases[1]. News from Brazil indicates that a new strain of the virus may have emerged there. Institute Adolfo Lutz, in S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, says it has isolated a new strain, \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x153;now known as A / Paulo/1454/H1N1 of swine flue . Authorities in New Zealand said widespread transmission of the virus meant it likely had more than 1,000 cases. \nThe Question before author is how severe is going to be this pandemic? Moderate or Severe? If it is moderately severe, for the developing and under developed countries with poor health infrastructure there, and whose populations often have high levels of underlying diseases like under nutrition, starvation, malnutrition, TB, HIV, [like in India where more then 25 cores people are living in bellow poverty line] risk of pandemic and toll of that pandemic is expected to become probably highest. There is lack of information&quot; on the pathogenesis and clinical feature of those with severe complications/ illness and treatment regime particularly who are showing unusually severe respiratory illness. Even in developed countries, the virus can cause severe and sometimes fatal illness in pregnant women, babies and people with underlying problems like asthma, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and autoimmune diseases. Most of the fatal infections reported so far had been in adults between the ages of 30 and 50 years[1] noticeably different from epidemics of seasonal influenza. People in those risk groups should seek treatment if they have a fever of at least 100.4, and a cough or a sore throat. The severity of the new virus does not even approach that of the 1918 one, which killed 40 million to 50 million people worldwide. But even the milder flu pandemics took serious death tolls. The one in 1957 killed two million people, and the 1968 pandemic killed about one million. Seasonal flu, by comparison, kills 250,000 to 500,000 people a year[2] The good news so far is that the virulence markers for the 1918 and H5N1 influenza viruses do not appear in the H1N1 strain\n No vaccine yet? Vaccine if at all is the final target for pharma industries as preventive one, then it must be thinking for a very cheap or  donation purpose  for the low income countries like India Bangladesh, African Courtiers and must not for a billion dollars profit. It really remains unclear when the companies would make any donated vaccine available, given its existing contracts with several rich countries and. Dr Margaret Chan said that a donation of five million courses of the antiviral Neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (Tamiflu) by the Roche group has been dispersed to 121 countries. She expected to receive a second donation of 5.6 million doses, part of which would be in paediatric formulation, which would be distributed worldwide so that countries would have something on hand to deal with the pandemic[1]  Neuraminidase cleaves sialic acid residues on the cellular receptor that bind the newly formed virions to the cell and to one another, enabling infection to spread to new host cells and ongoing infection to be established. The neuraminidase inhibitors mimic neuraminidase&apos;s natural substrate and bind to the active site, preventing the enzyme from cleaving host-cell receptors, thereby preventing infection of new host cells and halting the spread of infection. The two licensed neuraminidase inhibitors, zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu), have though  toxicity but are effective against all neuraminidase subtypes and, therefore, against all strains of influenza virus.   But resistance with antiviral oseltamivir (Tamiflu) already noted and spreading.H1N1 viruses containing the His274Tyr resistance mutation became widespread beginning with the 2007\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C;2008 influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere, with a prevalence of about 10% in the United States and about 25% in Europe (except for an astonishing prevalence of about 70% in Norway). These resistant viruses then predominated during the Southern Hemisphere&apos;s 2008 influenza season. In the United States today, H1N1 is the dominant circulating strain and is virtually 100% oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 viruses can cause serious complications, and recent data from Norway&apos;s 2007\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C;2008 influenza season suggest that patients infected with the resistant virus may be more likely to develop pneumonia or sinusitis than those infected with wild-type virus, although this finding did not reach statistical significance. Could a resistant strain of H3N2 influenza \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201D; the virus more commonly associated with death \u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201D; persist and be transmitted like the current H1N1 strain? In principle, it could, although it would most likely result from different resistance mutations on a different genetic background, given the structural differences between N1 and N2 neuraminidases. These differences mean, for example, that the His274Tyr mutation disrupts the oseltamivir-binding site on N1 but not on N2 and that the Arg292Lys mutation confers more resistance on N2 than N1.We cannot yet anticipate the precise combination of mutations that might enable fitness and persistence of a neuraminidase-inhibitor\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x201C;resistant H3N2 strain[3].  However No resistance cases Reported in India Yet.\nThere must be restrictions on travel, or border controls, at stopping spread, and  dr. chan called for countries to abstain from trade bans.\n\nReferences\n1)World Health Organization declares A (H1N1) influenza pandemic by John Zarocostas BMJ 2009;338:b2425\n2 By DONALD G.
