<p>A tight budget and unanticipated safety problems are threatening to kill plans to convert an abandoned gold mine in South Dakota into a $750 million deep underground science and engineering laboratory (DUSEL).</p>
<p>Since 2007, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) has been supporting a team of scientists and engineers developing plans to convert the Homestake mine near the town of Lead into an enormous lab for experiments in fields including particle and nuclear physics and geology and microbiology. Although NSF has not yet agreed to build DUSEL&#x2014;scientists are hoping for final approval as early as spring 2011 and the start of construction in 2013&#x2014;NSF is spending $36 million this year on the effort. But its 2011 budget, released last month, requests only $19 million to continue design work, half of what scientists and NSF program staff say is needed to keep the project on track.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, a recent review concluded that an additional $73 million is needed in the next 3 years to shore up aging mine shafts and make the space usable for research. That leaves the 2011 request some $40 million short of what&apos;s needed next year, Joseph Dehmer, director of NSF&apos;s division of physics, said at a meeting last week of the federal government&apos;s High-Energy Physics Advisory Panel. Without a significant boost in funding, Dehmer warned the panel, &#x201C;the project will be phased down in 2011 and 2012.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Edward Seidel, acting assistant director of NSF&apos;s mathematical and physical sciences directorate, declined to say how the projected shortfall came about. But it does not signify a lack of enthusiasm for the lab, he emphasized: &#x201C;No one should interpret this as a sign that we&apos;re not committed to the project. We understand its fantastic scientific potential.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Although $40 million is a drop in the bucket compared with the project&apos;s total cost, the money is critical to keeping people together, says Kevin Lesko, a physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who heads the design team. &#x201C;What&apos;s in the budget is nowhere near adequate to support that team through 2011,&#x201D; Lesko says. &#x201C;To dismantle that team and say, &#x2018;Come back next year,&#x2019; that&apos;s no way to treat professionals.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Part of the problem, according to Dehmer, is that much of the $19 million is already committed to private contractors and DUSEL-related science projects at different universities. As a result, he told panel members, &#x201C;the amount left for the project office to do the planning does not allow for a viable project.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The death of DUSEL, or a serious delay, would have effects that would ripple across the scientific community, says Milind Diwan, a physicist at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York. The blow would fall particularly hard on particle physicists at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois, which hopes in 2018 to begin shooting a beam of particles called neutrinos through Earth to an enormous particle detector hunkered deep within DUSEL.</p>
<p>Researchers at Fermilab currently shoot a neutrino beam to a detector in the Soudan mine in Minnesota. But the next generation of experiments requires a much longer baseline to accentuate the effects physicists hope to see. The distance from Fermilab to Homestake is twice that to Soudan, and Homestake is also twice as deep, which means that background radiation would be extremely low. &#x201C;If we didn&apos;t open DUSEL, we would be in trouble,&#x201D; says Pier Oddone, director of Fermilab.</p>
<p>However, Oddone is optimistic that NSF will remedy the problem before work grinds to a halt. &#x201C;From what I understand, people in the administration are working very hard to fix this,&#x201D; he says.</p>
