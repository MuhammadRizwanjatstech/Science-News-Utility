<title>Cellular Sample Cooling</title>
<fig id="F1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="327_1527a_F1"><alt-text>Figure 1</alt-text></graphic></fig>
<p>The mechanically refrigerated FTS Bio-Cool provides a reliable, safe, and quiet alternative to controlled-rate freezers that make use of liquid nitrogen as a refrigerant. Unlike liquid nitrogen systems, which surround samples with a cold vapor phase, the Bio-Cool immerses samples in a well-circulated, cold liquid bath. The circulating liquid allows for efficient heat transfer from the samples and maintains a consistent temperature profile at all locations. Featuring a small footprint, low operating costs, and high reliability, applications include the freezing of murine, bovine, or human embryos as well as the cryopreservation of embryonic stem cells. An easy-to-use programmable microprocessor controller can program and store up to eight different protocols, each with up to eight distinct segments specifying ramp rate, hold temperature, and hold time. </p>

<title>Vertical Pipetting Station</title>
<p>The Vertical Pipetting Station features a choice of easily interchangeable 8-, 16-, 96-, and 384-channel heads. A high-precision, two-axis positioning stage provides access to all quadrants of 96-, 384-, and 1,536-well microplates. The station features eight pneumatic sliding shelves arranged on either side of the pipetting head, permitting access to plates, while conserving deck space. The shelves can be custom-fitted with vacuum manifolds (to position warped polymerase chain reaction microplates), autofilling reagent shelves, or a tip-washing station. An intuitive user interface allows the operator to create and run complex pipetting protocols with ease. The unit's software features dynamic scheduling and innovative error recovery technology. Available as either a standalone unit or integrated into a larger robotic platform, the system can significantly reduce cycle time on demanding protocols. </p>

<title>Cuvette Option for Electroporation</title>
<p>The Gene Pulser MXcell ShockPod cuvette chamber for the Gene Pulser MXcell electroporation system offers researchers the flexibility to easily transition between electroporation plates and cuvettes. With the ShockPod the MXcell system can electroporate as few as 100,000 cells in a 96-well plate or as many as 10 million cells in a 12-well plate or cuvette. Regardless of delivery format, the ShockPod provides researchers with reliable data and highly reproducible results. The ShockPod can easily and rapidly optimize electroporation conditions. Every key feature of the Gene Pulser MXcell electroporation system is programmable&#x2014;from voltage to number of pulses&#x2014;enabling researchers to find the ideal set of conditions for their specific cells. </p>

<title>Submarine Gel Electrophoresis</title>
<p>New submarine gel electrophoresis units are constructed with 6-mm heavy-duty acrylic to endure years of use. Six sizes are available, from quick-screen 6 cm by 7.5 cm mini units to high throughput 25 cm by 25 cm Maxi-Plus units, providing a choice for every application. A wide variety of combs are available, many of which are compatible with multichannel pipettes. Color-coded and height-adjustable combs enable easy identification of gel thickness and control of well depth. Loading strips are included to assist in sample loading. Many of these units include recirculation ports for buffer recirculation during electrophoresis to maintain buffer pH and prevent ionic gradient formation. The Maxi and Maxi-Plus models are available with a cooling base. </p>
