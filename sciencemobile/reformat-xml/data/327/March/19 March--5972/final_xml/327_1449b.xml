<p><bold>Tiny find.</bold> The Stardust mission announced the discovery of its first candidate bits of mineral born around distant stars. The Stardust spacecraft returned plenty of easily identified particles from its close pass by comet Wild 2 (<italic>Science</italic>, 25 January 2008, p. <related-article related-article-type="in-this-publication" vol="319" page="401a" issue="5862">401</related-article>), but the rarer and smaller interstellar dust was harder to spot. An automatic microscope scanned 1.6 million different locations on the spacecraft's collector at 40 different depths at each location. But no one could teach a computer to recognize the tracks left by speeding stardust as it imbedded itself in the airy-light collector material.</p>
<p>Enter the &#x201C;dusters.&#x201D; Humans, it turns out, are easier to train for this sort of thing than computers. Twenty-seven thousand people volunteered. After 71 million searches conducted on home computers, two micrometer-size particles along a single track&#x2014;dubbed Orion (the mythical Hunter) and Sirius (his dog) by their duster discoverer&#x2014;have researchers &#x201C;cautiously excited&#x201D; that stardust is in hand, says Stardust team member Andrew Westphal of the University of California, Berkeley. If the particles are the real McCoy, researchers estimate that scores more like them remain to be found.</p>

<p><bold>Tilt-a-moon.</bold> Our nearest neighbor in space has always looked a little off, and now researchers think they may know why. At the meeting, planetary scientists Lissa Ong of the University of Arizona, Tucson, and Jay Melosh of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, reported considerable progress in making sense of the odd shape of the moon. Tidal forces should have left it more flattened side to side than it is now. But Ong and Melosh found that the huge impact billions of years ago that left the great South Pole&#x2013;Aitken basin would have blanketed the moon with tens to hundreds of meters of rocky debris. If that impact were in the center of the moon's leading face&#x2014;the most likely place for it&#x2014;that redistribution of mass could have given the moon its present shape, they calculate. The reshaping would also have spun the moon around by as much as 90&#x00B0;. So, an early violent resurfacing may have turned the gaze of the Woman in the Moon from upward to forward.</p>
