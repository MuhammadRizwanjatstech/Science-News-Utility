<p>A chemical reaction occurs when molecules collide, resulting in the re arrangement of the atomic nuclei from reactant to product configurations. The rearrangement dynamics takes place on the blindingly fast time scale of molecular vibrations (10<sup>&#x2212;14</sup> to 10<sup>&#x2212;13</sup> s). Sometimes, however, the nuclei can become temporarily trapped during a reactive collision, resulting in a metastable quantum state that typically lasts for 10<sup>&#x2212;13</sup> to 10<sup>&#x2212;12</sup> s before it decays into reactants or products. These short-lived states, called reactive resonances, are extremely difficult to observe. On page <related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="327" page="1501" issue="5972">1501</related-article> of this issue, Dong <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>) report the detection of three individual reactive resonances in the F + HD &#x2192; HF + D reaction.</p>
<p>Reactive resonances are an example of a more general type of quantum phenomenon called a scattering resonance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). A typical signature of such a resonance is a sharp peak as a function of collision energy in the scattering cross section (the flux of scattered particles divided by the flux per unit area of the incoming particles, and thus a measure of the fraction of particles scattered by the collision). Such resonances have, for example, been observed in the scattering of electrons from atoms and molecules, the scattering of atomic nuclei, and the scattering of sub-atomic particles, where scattering resonances indicate the formation of unstable particles.</p>
<p>In contrast to these other types of scattering resonance, reactive resonances are elusive, with only a few definite sightings reported to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>). Reactive resonances are not present in all reactions; when they do occur, their contribution to the cross section is often obscured by a much bigger contribution from products formed by direct reaction paths that do not involve reactive re sonances. Another difficulty is that the temporarily trapped atomic nuclei can rotate, giving rise to a progression of rotational quantum states, each of which is an individual reactive resonance. Typically, many such resonances contribute to a scattering cross section, where they tend to average out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>It is thus remarkable that Dong <italic>et al.</italic> were able to directly observe three individual reactive resonances in the F + HD reaction, corresponding to different rotational quantum states of the temporarily trapped FHD complex. Skodje <italic>et al.</italic> previously identified and interpreted this particular set of resonances after observing the averaged contribution from a sequence of the resonances in the cross sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Dong <italic>et al.</italic> are, however, the first to pick out individual resonances from this series.</p>

<title>Formation and decay of individual reactive resonances.</title>
<p>The DH molecule (blue and black) and F atom (red) form a metastable DHF complex by temporarily trapping the energy, <italic>v</italic>, in three vibrational quanta of excitation of the HF bond. The flow of one quantum of energy out of the bond causes the complex to break up into products. The overall angular momentum of the three atoms is quantized and gives rise to a progression of rotational quantum states, labeled by <italic>J</italic>; each rotational state of the complex is an individual reactive resonance.</p>

<p>These resonances are formed by collisions at such low energies that the nuclei can traverse the reaction barrier only by quantum tunneling. The resonances are formed on the product side of the barrier and survive for about 300 fs (1 fs = 10<sup>&#x2212;15</sup> s). They are held together because most of the energy is trapped in three quanta of vibrational excitation in the FH bond. The leakage of this energy into the other degrees of freedom causes the resonance to decay into products or back to reactants. The total angular momentum of the three atomic nuclei is conserved during the entire reactive collision, allowing the same quantum number <italic>J</italic> to be associated with overall rotation of the three nuclei at all stages of reaction (see the figure). The resonances observed by Dong <italic>et al.</italic> correspond to <italic>J</italic> = 12, 13, and 14. Resonances corresponding to other values of <italic>J</italic> also contribute to the cross sections, and further studies may resolve some of these.</p>
<p>The assignment of these resonances required close collaboration between experimental and theoretical groups. The resonances appeared as peaks in part of the cross section as a function of collision energy. However, similar progressions of peaks observed in the cross sections of other reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>) were caused by an entirely different sort of process, namely the opening of thresholds on top of the reaction barrier. To show that the F + HD peaks are reactive resonances, Dong <italic>et al.</italic> solved the Schr&#x00F6;dinger equation describing the motion of the atomic nuclei during the reaction, which showed that the wave functions responsible for the peaks correspond to reactive resonances.</p>
<p>Theoretical predictions of this type must be interpreted with caution, because they rely on potential energy surfaces (describing the forces between the nuclei) that are obtained by solving the electronic Schr&#x00F6;dinger equation. To reproduce features in the cross sections, these surfaces must be highly accurate (to within 0.1 kcal mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). This makes them computationally very expensive to calculate, even for &#x201C;simple&#x201D; reactions such as F + HD. It is thus essential to compare theory with experiment.</p>
<p>Dong <italic>et al.</italic>'s theoretical predictions match the experimental data almost perfectly [see Fig. 1 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>)]. The authors used a version of the crossed-beam technique that was originally used to study the F + H<sub>2</sub> reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). Over the years, this and related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>) molecular beam techniques have been steadily refined. Dong <italic>et al.</italic>'s experiment was fully &#x201C;state-to-state&#x201D;: The reactants were cooled to prepare the HD in its ground rovibrational state, and the cross sections were measured for the HF products in specific rovibrational quantum states as a simultaneous function of collision energy and scattering angle (of the HF products with respect to the F + HD approach vector).</p>
<p>The theoretical calculations used a potential surface obtained at a very high level of theory, which correctly describes electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>). Earlier studies on this system used a potential surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>) that was able to reproduce the transition-state spectrum of FHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>) and to predict qualitatively the features in the cross section produced by the rotationally averaged resonances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). The surface used by Dong <italic>et al.</italic> describes much better the interactions that hold together the nuclei within the resonances. This is why the individual resonance peaks obtained from it agree so closely with the experimental data.</p>
<p>The study by Dong <italic>et al.</italic> is a major benchmark in the understanding of chemical reactions from the point of view of first-principles quantum mechanics. The ability to detect and perhaps target individual reactive resonances may also allow chemists to better control chemical reactions, especially at very low temperatures.</p>
