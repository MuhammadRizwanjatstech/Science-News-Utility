<p>Museumgoers outside China will get their first look at early European and western Asian migrants to China on 27 March, when the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, California, opens a major exhibit, <italic>Secrets of the Silk Road</italic>. It features naturally preserved Caucasoid mummies, one as old as 3800 years, and 150 artifacts discovered in the arid Tarim Basin. Sinologist Victor Mair, left, of the University of Pennsylvania has studied the finds for nearly 20 years.</p>

<speaker>Q:</speaker>
<p><bold>Where did these Bronze Age migrants come from?</bold></p>
<p>I think from somewhere in the steppes north of the Black Sea and southwest of the Ural Mountains in Russia. &#x2026; These early people were buried with little baskets of wheat, and they were also cattle herders and sheep and goat herders. They were very good at making woolen clothing. &#x2026; I think that special kind of agropastoralist culture is related to the steppes.</p>

<speaker>Q:</speaker>
<p><bold>How did they survive in one of the most arid places on Earth?</bold></p>
<p>There were rivers extending out in the desert, and there's evidence of old poplar groves near some sites. So there would have been little strips of pasture for the animals.</p>

<speaker>Q:</speaker>
<p><bold>How did the opening of the Silk Road 2200 years ago change the population?</bold></p>
<p>More people started coming from Southwest Asia or even the Mediterranean. Yingpan Man [almost 200 centimeters tall] (right) is the only mummy whose limbs were wrapped in cloth, similar to the Egyptian practice. He has this elaborate caftan with classical Greek and Roman motifs. I think he was probably a wealthy trader from around Samarkand in Uzbekistan.</p>
