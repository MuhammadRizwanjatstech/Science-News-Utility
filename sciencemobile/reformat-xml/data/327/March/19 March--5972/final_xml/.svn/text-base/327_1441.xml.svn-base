Now researchers report that part of the answer may be hypersensitivity to rewards, which may create a pathological drive for money, sex, and status.</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bit.ly/oceaniron"><bold>Carbon-Capture Method Could Poison Oceans</bold></ext-link> To help cool a warming world, some scientists have suggested fertilizing the oceans with iron. The idea is to stimulate vast blooms of phytoplankton, which sequester carbon dioxide. But such an approach could have deadly consequences. Experiments in the sub-Arctic show that phytoplankton in some regions of the Pacific produce domoic acid, a neurotoxin that has killed wildlife and people in coastal areas.</p>

But they might want to carry hand sanitizer, too, ac-cording to a new study that suggests a new way to finger perpetrators from their skin bacteria.</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bit.ly/memorytrace"><bold>Pardon, Your Thoughts Are Showing</bold></ext-link> Your thoughts leave a trace&#x2014;and it&apos;s visible. Researchers have successfully identified the memory a person is recalling by analyzing their brain activity. The result offers new insights into how and where the brain records memories and may help scientists understand memory impairments caused by injuries, aging, and neuro-logical conditions such as a stroke.</p>
