<p>Scientists, as others in Chile, were hit hard by the 27 February earthquake. Two days after the earthquake, I traveled to Santiago and visited the University of Chile (Universidad de Chile), one of the two largest state universities in Chile. My friend and collaborator Maria Rosa Bono gave me a tour of the science campus, which had suffered substantial damage. Several walls were down, and people were using shovels and wheelbarrows to carry rubble out of buildings. There was neither water nor electricity, and an eerie atmosphere enveloped the campus.</p>
<p>As we walked by the animal facility, we saw water seeping below the door. We used a flashlight to find our way through ankle-deep water to locate the source of the flooding: a broken pipe with water pouring out. After some effort, we managed to stop the water.</p>
<p>The last major earthquake in Chile was in 1985. Maria Rosa experienced that event firsthand and learned lifelong lessons about lab preservation as a result. In her lab, all the solvents were stored in rigid plastic boxes on the floor and shelves were screwed to the walls. For 25 years, she has told her students to push the microscope against the wall at the end of the day. Generations of students probably felt this was a useless precaution, but not today.</p>
<p>The scientists I spoke to in the immediate aftermath of this earthquake were universally calm and determined in the face of daunting setbacks. If there is anything positive to take away from this earthquake, it is renewed appreciation of our courageous Chilean colleagues as they move forward to confront these challenges.</p>
