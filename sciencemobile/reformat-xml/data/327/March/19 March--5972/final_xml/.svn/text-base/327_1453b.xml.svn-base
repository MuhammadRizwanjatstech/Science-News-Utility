<body>
<p>In their 2009 Policy Forum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>), B. Walker <italic>et al.</italic> called for greater interaction among existing institutions to tackle global-scale challenges. In April 2009, leading scientists, politicians, economists, and academics, as well as representatives from European Union Member States, civil society, and business put forward the Message from Athens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>): eight key priorities in EU biodiversity policy. Key priority 7 emphasizes the need for integration of the EU nature directives into other policy areas such as agriculture and regional development. The EU directives are an excellent example of the kind of cooperation that Walker <italic>et al.</italic> were calling for. However, it appears that the message is not being heard by the public at large nor by some leaders.</p>
<p>Natura 2000 is the European Union's main policy instrument to address the loss of biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>). It is a network of nature protection areas established under the 1992 Habitats Directive and 1979 Birds Directive. Most of the protected land is expected to continue to be privately owned, and ecologically and economically sustainable development is a goal.</p>
<p>In Western Europe, planned dredging of the Scheldt River estuary in the Netherlands for the benefit of Antwerp harbor in Belgium puts at risk surrounding foraging and breeding grounds for birds protected under EU legislation. Under the Directives, loss of these Natura 2000 sites requires compensation measures, such as restoration of tidal mudflats. This implies flooding of Dutch agricultural polder land. Debate about the conflicting issues of bird protection and food production has begun to surface in the Dutch press [e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>)]. The situation is also being seen as a conflict between a distant EU interest and local sacrifice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). The resigning Dutch Prime Minister Jan-Peter Balkenende stated, in an attempt to weaken the EU nature directives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>), that &#x201C;Natura 2000&#x2026;overshoots the mark&#x201D; and that public support for nature and biodiversity policy in the Netherlands (an EU member state) was diminishing. Jos&#x00E9; Manuel Barroso (President of the EU Commission) replied to the Dutch leader that a review of the directives would not be justified because &#x201C;economic operators benefit from a stable and predictable legislative framework&#x201D; and &#x201C;the inevitable legal uncertainty that would be caused by a review would be likely to slow down the development of existing plans and projects&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>The EU nature directives are supranational and enforceable, working toward a global view on issues that transcend local priorities. Unfortunately, these efforts are misunderstood, unappreciated, or feared, and the economic crisis offers further incentives to brush them aside. However, this directive tool is unique in an international context, as it overrides local interests when global issues are at stake. The EU nature directives strive to integrate conservation with human activity, wherever needed, and a confrontation should not be necessary. Although the strength of the directive tool is clear, the Message from Athens has apparently not been communicated effectively, not even to a political leader in a member state, and the European Union must think hard about how to bridge the divide.</p>
