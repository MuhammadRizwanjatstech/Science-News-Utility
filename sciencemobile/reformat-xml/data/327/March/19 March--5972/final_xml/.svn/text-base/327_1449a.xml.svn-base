<p>Spirit's roving days are over, right? Back in January, NASA announced that after 6 years on Mars, the plucky rover was being consigned to purely stationary duty right where it had become stuck in a sort of dry quicksand. Rover obituaries proliferated. But at the meeting, the talk was of Spirit's resurrection as a rover, or at least a realistic prospect of a return to limited mobility. NASA missions are indeed hard to kill (<italic>Science</italic>, 22 May 2009, p. <related-article related-article-type="in-this-publication" vol="324" page="998" issue="5930">998</related-article>).</p>
<p>NASA retired Spirit after the rover became stuck last May and failed to extricate itself. Trundling toward its next target, a likely volcanic vent 200 meters away, Spirit broke through a surface crust and bogged down in fluffy sulfate sand. Repeated attempts to escape forward&#x2014;guided by testing of a mockup in the Mars &#x201C;sandbox&#x201D; at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California&#x2014;yielded millimeters of progress and not many of those, says Raymond Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, deputy principal investigator of the Mars Exploration Rover mission. That's when NASA threw in the towel.</p>
<p>But then Spirit's operators figured, what the heck, let's try reverse. They also threw in a little wiggling-the-wheels maneuver intended to move some soil out of the way before each attempt at driving. It worked, a bit. Instead of a millimeter or two of progress per driving session, Spirit made several centimeters. Before it had to be settled in for a long winter's nap as the available solar power dwindled, Spirit covered 34 centimeters backward, according to Arvidson. &#x201C;I really think we can continue this kind of breaststroke and extricate it,&#x201D; he says.</p>
<p>First, Spirit must survive the winter. Its handlers are guardedly optimistic that its power levels will not drop so far that the rover's electronics freeze, but no one is making any promises. Next September or October, as spring returns to Mars, Spirit will likely serve 6 months' duty as an essentially stationary geodetic marker in a study of the planet's core.</p>
<p>All the while, &#x201C;there'll be a discussion of what Spirit becomes,&#x201D; says Arvidson. &#x201C;There's a lot to do,&#x201D; even if Spirit&#x2014;now down from six operable wheels to four&#x2014;can only hobble along centimeter by centimeter. But in the end, it will be NASA headquarters that decides whether a rover with &#x201C;limited mobility&#x201D; is worth $27,000 a day in operating costs. If not, it will have to pull the plug.</p>
