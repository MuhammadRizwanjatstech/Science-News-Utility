<p>Five years ago, the out-of-control Genesis sample-return capsule bored into the Utah desert at 360 kilometers per hour (<italic>Science</italic>, 17 September 2004, p. <related-article related-article-type="in-this-publication" vol="305" page="1689a" issue="5691">1689</related-article>). But things have been looking up for the space mission, which returned atomic bits of the sun and thus samples of the solar system's primordial material. &#x201C;With that big splash at the end, it was an interesting little mission,&#x201D; recalls cosmochemist Roger Wiens of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.</p>
<p>At the meeting, Genesis team members confirmed their measurement of the isotopic composition of the solar wind's oxygen (<italic>Science</italic>, 28 March 2008, p. <related-article related-article-type="in-this-publication" vol="319" page="1756a" issue="5871">1756</related-article>) and reported an isotopic composition for solar-wind nitrogen. Compared with the solar wind, &#x201C;nitrogen on Earth is heavy,&#x201D; pronounced cosmochemist Antti Kallio of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). By such threads will hang the story of how the stuff of stars became planets.</p>
<p>The $264 million Genesis mission went swimmingly, up to its rough landing. The Genesis spacecraft cruised the solar system for 3 years, exposing collection plates to the onrushing solar wind. The sample capsule reentered Earth's atmosphere loaded with embedded atomic particles from the sun. Then, its parachute failed to open (<italic>Science</italic>, 22 October 2004, p. <related-article related-article-type="in-this-publication" vol="306" page="587b" issue="5696">587</related-article>). But team members picked up the pieces&#x2014;all 10,000 of them&#x2014;and proceeded to clean and analyze them. At UCLA, a team led by cosmochemist Kevin McKeegan had built the 8-ton MegaSIMS, &#x201C;a custom-made hybrid secondary ionization/accelerator mass spectrometer&#x201D;&#x2014;that is, an analytical instrument for extracting and &#x201C;weighing&#x201D; each isotope.</p>

<p>Before the latest MegaSIMS results, measurements of the ratio of nitrogen's rare heavier isotope, nitrogen-15, to nitrogen-14 had been all over the map. The UCLA value for the sun (&#x2212;470 &#x00B1; 100 per mil) looks &#x201C;fairly robust,&#x201D; Kallio said, and roughly equals the isotopic ratio for Jupiter retrieved by spacecraft as well as the value for a primordial component of meteorites. If the number is correct, Earth's nitrogen has relatively more of nitrogen's rare heavy isotope than the solar system's starting material does.</p>
<p>&#x201C;How did it get that way?&#x201D; asks Wiens. Drawing on the isotopic compositions of other elements, researchers will be testing some possibilities: an infall of comets, solar wind erosion of the early atmosphere, blasting of the primordial nebula by the sun, or some combination of these. In the meantime, Genesis analysts are taking up their next element, carbon.</p>
