<p><bold>BEIJING</bold>&#x2014;Pressing social problems such as the rich-poor gap and the rights of migrant workers eclipsed science at China&apos;s annual exercise in socialist democracy: last week&apos;s meetings of the National People&apos;s Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People&apos;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), or <italic>Liang Hui</italic>. But science won high praise and a hefty budget boost. Central government spending on science and technology is slated to rise 8% to $24 billion in 2010. And science features prominently in several CPPCC proposals.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We need to emancipate our minds and boldly make breakthroughs and innovations,&#x201D; Premier Wen Jiabao said in presenting the work plan at NPC. He said his government &#x201C;will make farsighted arrangements&#x201D; to support several research areas, including nanoscience, climate change, aerospace, and oceanography. Wen also pledged to &#x201C;energetically attract high-caliber personnel from overseas.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to figures released last month by the State Bureau of Statistics, China&apos;s total R&amp;D spending in 2009&#x2014;from central and local governments and industry&#x2014;was $79 billion, including $4 billion for basic research. This year, the main basic research funding agency, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, is slated to receive a 30% budget increase to $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Although the public has little input into the workings of government, one forum that can effect change is CPPCC, an appointed body whose ranks include sports heroes and other glitterati, scientists, and Communist Party officials. At this year&apos;s CPPCC plenary session, 5430 proposals were submitted. Most are expected to be shelved. In recent years, for example, proposals to create better conditions for postdocs and a top scientific journal for China sank without a trace. But a few of this year&apos;s proposals have passed party vetting and are being taken seriously, including ideas for forging a low-carbon economy (see <related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="327" page="1440-a" issue="5972">main text</related-article>).</p>
<p>Reflecting persistent concerns over food safety, several highly rated CPPCC proposals call for a regulatory overhaul and improved surveillance and risk assessment. These jibe with the plans of the government, which last month established a food security committee chaired by Vice Premier Li Keqiang. &#x201C;It&apos;s difficult to change the regulatory system overnight,&#x201D; says health minister Chen Zhu, a CPPCC delegate. But the new committee will improve coordination, he says. And increased capacity for surveillance and risk assessment, Chen says, &#x201C;should be enhanced without any delay.&#x201D;</p>
<p>One CPPCC delegate has urged the government to pay more attention to rare diseases. The proposal from Li Ding-Guo of Shanghai Second Medical University urges the health ministry to improve tracking of rare diseases and establish an office to oversee orphan drug procurement and ensure insurance coverage. The proposal, which has also passed vetting, &#x201C;is absolutely right,&#x201D; says Chen. &#x201C;Special policies will be made to ensure the availability of essential orphan drugs.&#x201D;</p>
