<p>For males of some species, mating is just the first step toward winning the battle to pass on their genes. Females sometimes mate more than once in quick succession, filling their reproductive tract with rival sperm that must compete for access to the unfertilized eggs. Two groups now show details of what life must be like for those sperm, with one offering unprecedented movies of this sperm competition. On page <related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="327" page="1506" issue="5972">1506</related-article>, Susanne P. A. den Boer of the University of Copenhagen demonstrates that such rivalries in some ants and bees have led to the evolution of seminal fluids containing toxins that impede rival sperm and to female fluids that counter these toxins. Another team, reporting online in <italic>Science</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/science.1187096">www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/science.1187096</ext-link>), followed red- or green-glowing sperm as they jockeyed their way through the reproductive tracts of fruit flies. Both papers drive home the point that &#x201C;the competition between males continues in a very fierce way&#x201D; inside the female, says Tommaso Pizzari, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The papers provide a glimpse of where evolutionary biology research is going: The female reproductive tract is &#x201C;one of the great, unexplored frontiers for the fields of sexual selection and speciation,&#x201D; says Scott Pitnick, an evolutionary biologist at Syracuse University in New York state.</p>

<p>Pitnick&apos;s Syracuse colleague John Belote entered this frontier by developing two fruit fly lines that produce different fluorescent proteins in the sperm head, one green and the other red. After allowing female fruit flies to mate with one strain and then the other a few days later, Pitnick&apos;s postdoctoral fellow Mollie Manier videotaped the streams of red and green sperm, tracking their interactions in real time. The first sperm in the reproductive tract swim to the fly&apos;s sperm-storage organ, but many are displaced by the second wave of sperm, she found. However, once both males&apos; sperm were settled, they all seemed to have an equal chance of fertilizing an egg.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is one of the most exciting developments in evolutionary and reproductive biology&#x2014;and will revolutionize the field,&#x201D; says Tim Birkhead, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sheffield, United Kingdom. &#x201C;After seeing these videos, researchers will now think of sperm competition in a new way.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Den Boer, University of Copenhagen colleague Jacobus Boomsma, and Boris Baer, now at the University of Perth in Australia, find sperm in some bees and ants do more than physically displace rivals. The team compared sperm dynamics within ant and bee queens that mate only once with ones in which females mate multiple times during a single courtship flight and store sperm for years. For the multiple mating species studied, two leafcutter ants and the honey bee, seminal fluid from a given male enhanced the survival time of its own sperm in a lab dish but damaged unrelated sperm and even sperm from a brother. Adding spermathecal fluid that ant queens make within their reproductive tract countered these effects, says Boomsma. In contrast, seminal fluids from singly mated bumble bees and ants showed none of these negative effects.</p>
<p>Sperm facing competition have evolved some as-yet-to-be-defined seminal fluid components that somehow recognize and thwart rivals, says Boomsma. But once the sperm reach their destination for long-term storage, the female apparently wants to keep all the sperm healthy and has evolved ways to counter the seminal fluid. This study &#x201C;beautifully reveals just how nuanced reproduction can be,&#x201D; says Pitnick. &#x201C;There will be much to gain from combining our respective approaches.&#x201D;</p>
