<p>Water is turning up on the moon in unexpected places and quantities, but scientists almost missed the big splash. Without a bit of good fortune when NASA blasted the moon last October, they would have gotten &#x201C;zippo,&#x201D; says Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) team member Peter Schultz of Brown University.</p>
<p>LCROSS scientists and engineers aimed a spent rocket upper stage at the moon's frigid, shadowed Cabeus crater, hoping to blast some rock and buried water ice into view (<italic>Science</italic>, 20 November 2009, p. <related-article related-article-type="in-this-publication" vol="326" page="1046-a" issue="5956">1046</related-article>). But when the impactor hit its target, scores of telescopic observers back on Earth saw no dusty debris. Luckily, the LCROSS spacecraft following close behind returned abundant evidence of long-sought water.</p>
<p>The near-emptiness of the spent rocket stage made all the difference. To team members' surprise, being hollow allowed the impactor to splash debris not only low and to the sides&#x2014;as modeling of solid impactors had predicted&#x2014;but also nearly straight up, Schultz says. Earth-bound observers couldn't see the low-angle ejecta behind an intervening mountain, and viewed side-on the high-angle plume was too meager for them to detect so far.</p>
<p>LCROSS, on the other hand, was looking straight down the high-angle plume, giving its sensors a strong water signal. At the meeting, LCROSS principal investigator Anthony Colaprete of NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, confirmed the team's estimate of at least 2% water by weight in the top couple of meters of Cabeus soil. He also reported the first detection of water ice in the plume, not just water vapor. The ice means the water is not simply locked up in minerals.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the moon, water is showing up through less violent means. Planetary scientist Igor Mitrofanov of the Institute for Space Research in Moscow reported another find by the Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND) instrument on board NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which guided the LCROSS team to Cabeus's water. Now LEND is detecting signs of water&#x2014;in the form of enhanced subsurface hydrogen&#x2014;in two other areas near the south pole. That's remarkable, said Mitrofanov, because unlike the floor of Cabeus, these areas are not in permanent shadow. The sun shines on them and warms them. Scientists looking for water had ignored such areas, assuming they would be too warm to retain water ice.</p>
<p>But Mitrofanov says that planetary scientist David Paige of the University of California, Los Angeles, a member of LRO's Diviner temperature-sensing instrument team, has calculated that buried ice can survive outside permanently shadowed craters. In the newly identified hydrogen-rich areas, Paige finds, some tens of centimeters of lunar soil are enough to insulate and preserve deeper water ice. That would be good news for astronauts; they could mine the key lunar resource without venturing into some of the coldest spots in the solar system, whenever they get to the moon again.</p>
<p>Still, the real water bonanza may lie in the north. Planetary scientist Paul Spudis of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas, and colleagues recently flew a ground-penetrating radar on India's Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter. At the meeting, they reported a distinctive radar signature from the interiors but not the surroundings of more than 40 small craters in the north polar region. Almost all of the craters are permanently shadowed.</p>
<p>That combination, Spudis argues, suggests ice, perhaps as much as 80% or 90% pure. But the Chandrayaan-1 radar is not confirming long-suspect reports of radar detection of massive ice in the south (<italic>Science</italic>, 13 March 1998, p. <related-article related-article-type="in-this-publication" vol="279" page="1628a" issue="5357">1628</related-article>), so most researchers are reserving judgment. They do agree on one thing: Someone, or something, needs to return to the moon to touch its water.</p>
