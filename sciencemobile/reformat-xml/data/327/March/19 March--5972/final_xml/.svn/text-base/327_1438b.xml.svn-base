<p>The dean of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge is in line to become the next director of the National Science Foundation (NSF).</p>
<p><italic>Science</italic> has learned that Subra Suresh, 53, has been tapped to succeed Arden Bement, who announced last month that he would be stepping down before his 6-year term ends in November. The National Science Board, NSF&apos;s oversight body, was informed last month that Suresh was the White House&apos;s pick. He is currently undergoing vetting, a process that could take weeks or longer, and if nominated he would need to be approved by the Senate.</p>

<p>The Indian-born Suresh is not well known in U.S. science-policy circles. But those who have worked with him rave about his scientific accomplishments in the emerging field of nanobiomechanics as well as his administrative talents. &#x201C;Subra represents the new style of science and engineering,&#x201D; says former MIT President Charles Vest, now president of the National Academy of Engineering, to which Suresh was elected in 2003. &#x201C;He has done amazing work on the mechanics of individual cells, and he&apos;s used to working with interdisciplinary teams. As a dean, he has been a leader in helping create powerful interdisciplinary entities such as the new Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, the Center for Computational Engineering, and Transportation@MIT,&#x201D; an initiative by the engineering, business, and architecture schools to examine the global environmental impact of an increasingly mobile society.</p>
<p>Suresh declined to comment on whether he was under consideration. But there are indications he&apos;s already in step with the Obama Administration. In a January 2009 blog for <italic>Technology Review</italic> about a &#x201C;dream stimulus package,&#x201D; Suresh proposed highspeed railways as a way to &#x201C;stimulate worker productivity and the economy while reducing our damage to the environment.&#x201D; The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act included $8 billion for such purposes. Suresh also called on the new president to reverse Bush Administration policies that he said have undermined the nation&apos;s &#x201C;ecosystem of scholarship and innovation &#x2026; [bringing it] perilously close to a tipping point.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai, Suresh received his doctoral degree from MIT in 1981 and taught at Brown University before joining the MIT faculty in 1991. He was chair of the department of materials science and engineering before becoming dean of engineering, the largest of MIT&apos;s five schools, in 2007.</p>
<p>The choice of an active researcher would be a departure from the norm at NSF, which has traditionally been led by senior administrators whose days in the laboratory are mostly a memory. That trait is believed to have put him at the top of the list of candidates to succeed the 77-year-old Bement, who is stepping down on 1 June to lead a new global policy research institute at Purdue University, where he has been on leave.</p>
<p>Suresh&apos;s colleague, Science Dean Marc Kastner, says that his departure &#x201C;would leave a tremendous hole for MIT to fill. But the scientific community would be lucky to have him at NSF.&#x201D;</p>
