<p>We completely agree that multiple mechanisms should be used to ensure security; we would only go further to say that we should not force everyone to use the same multiple mechanisms. The essence of our proposal is that what should be &#x201C;built in&#x201D; to the Internet is a mechanism to allow user-defined end-to-end security protocols.</p>
<p>Our approach allows the use of perimeter defense, but also allows other approaches to be used if they are desired. It also allows for creating security appropriate to applications not currently envisioned. Finally, it permits multiple implementations of the same security policy so that if there is a bug in one of the implementations, it doesn't open the door to all systems.</p>
<p>By all means, if you want a lock on your door, have one. Have three if that makes you feel better. But your town isn't secure if all the locks open to the same master key! Having a single implementation of a single security policy has precisely this vulnerability.</p>
